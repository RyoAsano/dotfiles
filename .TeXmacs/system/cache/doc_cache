  <tmdoc-title|Creating, saving and loading documents>

  When launching <TeXmacs> without any command line options, the editor
  automatically creates a new document for you. You may also create a new
  document yourself using <menu|File|New>. Newly created documents do not yet
  carry a name. In order to give them a name, you should click on
  <menu|File|Save as>. We recommend you to give documents a name immediately
  after their creation; this will avoid you to loose documents.

  It is also recommended to specify the global settings for your document
  when necessary. First of all, you may specify a document style like
  article, book or seminar using <menu|Document|Style>. If you write
  documents in several languages, then you may want to specify the language
  of your document using <menu|Document|Language>. Similarly, you may specify
  a paper type using <menu|Document|Page|Size>.

  For newly started documents, the style and page size can also be specified
  in the <menu|Focus> menu or buttons on the <em|focus toolbar>. In general,
  the focus menu and toolbar are useful for editing <hlink|structured
  documents|../text/man-structure.en.tm>, and their contents will be highly
  dependent on the current context.

  After modifying your document, you may save it using <menu|File|Save>. Old
  documents can be retrieved using <menu|File|Load>. \ Notice that you can
  edit several documents in the same window using <TeXmacs>; you can switch
  between different <em|buffers> using <menu|Go>.

  <tmdoc-title|Important changes in <TeXmacs>>

  Below, we briefly describe the most important changes which have occurred
  in <TeXmacs> since version 0.3.3.15. We also maintain a more detailed
  <hlink|change log|change-log.en.tm>.

  In general, when upgrading to a new version, we recommend you to make
  backups of your old <TeXmacs> files before opening them with the newer
  version of <TeXmacs>. In the unlikely case when your old file does not open
  in the correct way, please send a bug report to

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ bugs@texmacs.org
  </verbatim>

  and send your old document as an attached file. Do not forget to mention
  your version of <TeXmacs> and the system you are using.

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|User preferences>

  For an optimal typing experience, you may wish to configure <TeXmacs> in a
  way which suits your needs best. This can be done from within the
  <menu|Edit|Preferences> menu. Most importantly, you should choose a ``look
  and feel'' in <menu|Edit|Preferences|Look and feel>. This will enable you
  for instance to let the keyboard shortcuts used by <TeXmacs> be similar to
  what you are used to in other applications.

  The following user preferences are available:

  <\description>
    <item*|<menu|Look and feel>><label|preferences:look-and-feel>This
    preference controls the general ``look and feel'' of <TeXmacs>, and
    mainly affects the behaviour of the keyboard. The <menu|default> look and
    feel depends on your system (<menu|Gnome>, <menu|KDE> or <menu|Emacs>
    under <name|Linux>, <menu|Mac OS> under <name|Mac OS>, and <menu|Windows>
    under <name|Windows>). The <menu|Emacs> look and feel can be used as an
    alternative on all systems; it has been the default for all <TeXmacs>
    versions prior to<nbsp>1.0.7.6.

    More details on the <hlink|keyboard configuration on different
    systems|man-config-keyboard.en.tm> can be found below.

    <item*|<menu|Interactive questions>>This preference specifies how the
    user will be prompted for input when required. Questions may either be
    displayed in separate windows or on the status bar of <TeXmacs>.

    <item*|<menu|Details in menus>>This preference specify the level of
    detail in the menus. The less frequently used features will be left out
    when selecting <menu|Simplified menus>.

    <item*|<menu|View>>The preference corresponds to the same viewing options
    as in the top-level <menu|View><nbsp>menu.

    <item*|<menu|Language>>Your preferred language for the <TeXmacs>
    interface.

    <item*|<menu|Keyboard>><label|preferences:keyboard>In addition to the
    general look and feel, a few additional settings determine the behaviour
    of the keyboard:

    <\itemize>
      <item>The <menu|Cyrillic input method> specifies <hlink|how to type
      text in Cyrillic languages|man-russian.en.tm>.

      <item>Quotes can be automatically closed according to the
      <menu|Automatic quotes> style.

      <item>Brackets can be automatically closed by enabling
      <menu|Automatically close brackets>.
    </itemize>

    <item*|<menu|Printer>>The printer setup can be configured from this
    submenu.

    <item*|<menu|Security>>In theory, <TeXmacs> documents may embed macros or
    hyperlinks which give rise to the execution of arbitrary commands (as
    specified by the author). In practice, this feature may involve a
    security risk,. Therefore, the <menu|Security> preference allows the user
    to specify what should be done with untrusted executable code.

    <item*|<menu|Converters>>The behaviour of converters between <TeXmacs>
    various other data formats may be configured from this menu. For more
    details, we refer to the <hlink|chapter on compatibility with other
    formats|../convert/man-convert.en.tm>.

    <item*|<menu|Scripts>>Specify a default scripting language for all
    external scripts.

    <item*|<menu|Tools>><TeXmacs> features a few additional tools which the
    user may wish to work under certain circumstances:

    <\itemize>
      <item>A debugging tool for <TeXmacs> developers.

      <item>A linking tool for entering typed hyperlinks and complex
      annotations.

      <item>A versioning tool for comparing two versions of a <TeXmacs>
      document.

      <item>A remote connection tool (which currently does not work anymore).
    </itemize>

    <item*|<menu|Autosave>>This preference specifies how often documents will
    be ``autosaved''. Any edits to a file which was not autosaved will be
    lost on undesired termination of <TeXmacs>. This typically occurs after
    an erroneous manipulations by the user, certain bugs in <TeXmacs>, or a
    power problem.

    <item*|<menu|Bibtex command>>The user may specify an alternative to
    <verbatim|bibtex> for the compilation of bibliographies using <BibTeX>.
    Notice that recent versions of <TeXmacs> integrate a<nbsp>native
    alternative tool for the compilation of bibliographies.

  <tmdoc-title|Using sectional tags>

  The <tmdtd|section-base> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides the standard tags for
  sections, which are the same as in <LaTeX>. Most sectional tags take one
  argument: the name of the section. The intention of the following tags is
  to produce numbered sections:

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|part|title>, <explain-macro|chapter|title>

    <explain-macro|section|title>, <explain-macro|subsection|title>,
    <explain-macro|subsubsection|title>

    <explain-macro|paragraph|title>, <explain-macro|subparagraph|title>

    <explain-macro|appendix|title>
  <|explain>
    The intention of these macros is to produce a numbered title for a part
    (<abbr|resp.> chapter, section, subsection, <abbr|etc.>). The numbering
    is not required, but merely an intention: the <markup|paragraph> and
    <markup|subparagraph> tags are usually not numbered and some styles may
    not produce numbers at all.
  </explain>

  The tags <markup|part*>, <markup|chapter*>, <markup|section*>,
  <markup|subsection*>, <markup|subsubsection*>, <markup|paragraph*>,
  <markup|subparagraph*> and <markup|appendix*> can be used for producing the
  unnumbered variants of the above tags.

  By default, all sectional only produce the section title. When using the
  experimental package <tmpackage|structured-section>, all sectional tags are
  enriched, so that they take the body of the section as an optional
  argument. Moreover, an additional tag <markup|rsection> is provided in
  order to produce recursively embedded sections. For instance, an
  <markup|rsection> inside a <markup|section> behaves like a
  <markup|subsection>. In the future, all list items should become
  structured.

  The <tmdtd|section-base> <abbr|d.t.d.> also provides the following
  sectional environments with automatically generated content

  <\explain|<explain-macro|bibliography|aux|style|file-name|body>>
    This macro is used for producing bibliographies. The first argument
    <src-arg|aux> specifies the auxiliary channel with the data for
    generating the bibliography (<verbatim|bib>, by default). The arguments
    <src-arg|style> and <src-arg|file-name> contain the bibliography style
    and the file with the bibliographic database. The <src-arg|body> argument
    corresponds to the automatically generated content.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|table-of-contents|aux|body>>
    This macro is used for producing tables of contents. The first argument
    <src-arg|aux> specifies the auxiliary channel with the data for
    generating the bibliography (<verbatim|toc>, by default). The
    <src-arg|body> argument corresponds to the automatically generated
    content.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|the-index|aux|body>>
    Similar to <markup|table-of-contents> but for indices and default channel
    <verbatim|idx>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|the-glossary|aux|body>

    <explain-macro|list-of-figures|aux|body>

    <explain-macro|list-of-tables|aux|body>
  <|explain>
    Similar to <markup|table-of-contents> but for glossaries (default channel
    <verbatim|gly>), lists of figures (default channel <verbatim|figure>) and
    lists of tables (default channel <verbatim|table>).
  </explain>

  The above tags also admit the variants <markup|bibliography*>,
  <markup|table-of-contents*>, <markup|the-index*> and <markup|the-glossary*>
  with an additional argument <src-arg|name> before <src-arg|body>, which
  specifies the name of the section. For instance, the <markup|the-glossary*>
  was formerly used for lists of figures and lists of tables.

  <tmdoc-title|Semantic editing facilities>

  Starting with version 1.0.7.10, <TeXmacs> incorporates several features for
  the ``semantic'' editing of mathematical formulas. When used appropriately,
  this allows you to write documents in which all formulas are at least
  correct from a syntactical point of view. For instance, in the formulas
  <math|a+b>, the computer will understand that <math|+> is an operator which
  applies to the arguments <math|a> and <math|b>. Notice that our
  ``semantics'' does not go any further: <TeXmacs> is unaware of the
  mathematical nature of addition.

  Semantic editing does require additional efforts from the user, at least a
  little adaptation. For instance, it is the user's job to enter
  multiplications using the shortcut <key|*> and function applications using
  <key|space>. Indeed, from the graphical point of view, these operations
  cannot be distinguished, since they are both printed as invisible
  whitespace. However, the semantics of these operations is clearly very
  different.

  Although semantically correct documents are usually not very different from
  informal presentation-oriented documents as far as typesetting is
  concerned, the additional user effort may pay off for several reasons:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Documents with more semantics are for instance useful when using
    formulas as inputs for a computer algebra system.

    <item>Syntactically correct documents are less likely to contain
    ``typos'' or more intricate mathematical errors.

    <item>For certain editing operations, such as cut and paste, one may
    directly select subformulas which are meaningful from the syntactical
    point of view.

    <item>It reduces the risk of using non standard notations, which will be
    difficult to understand for potential readers of your work.
  </itemize>

  Furthermore, other semantic facilities might be integrated in the feature,
  such as semantic search and replace, or semantic search on the web.

  In order to activate the semantic editing facilities, please toggle
  <menu|Edit|Preferences|Mathematics|Semantic editing>. In the semantic
  editing mode, several of the structured editing features of <TeXmacs> apply
  to the syntactic structure of the formula, rather than the visual structure
  of the document. For instance, the <em|semantic
  focus><label|semantic-focus> is usually a subformula of the <hlink|current
  focus|../../text/man-structure.en.tm>. Similarly, only syntactically
  meaningful subformulas can be selected when making a selection.

  The semantic focus is useful for several reasons. First of all, it is
  displayed in green if the formula is syntactically correct and in red if
  you made an error. This allows to quickly notice any typos while entering a
  formula. Secondly, if you have any doubt on the precedence of a
  mathematical operator or relation, then the semantic focus will inform you
  on the default interpretation: by putting your cursor right next to your
  operator, the subexpression to which the operator applies will be
  highlighted. In the case of an addition, or a more general associative
  operator, all summands are highlighted.

  <tmdoc-title|Formats of database entries>

  From the high-level point of view, it is often useful to manipulate
  database values as other objects than raw strings. In <scm|db-format.scm>,
  an additional layer is added to the basic database API which allows you to
  specify encoding and decoding schemes between raw strings and user defined
  data formats for specific types of entries and attributes. More precisely,
  the extension introduces the following tables:

  <\description>
    <item*|<scm|db-kind-table>>For each ``kind'' of database (<abbr|e.g.>
    <scm|"bib"> for bibliographies), specify a finite list of supported entry
    types (<abbr|e.g.> <scm|"article">, <scm|"book">, <abbr|etc.> for
    bibliographies).

    <item*|<scm|db-format-table>>For each entry type, specify the format of
    the fields: mandatory fields, alternative fields and/or optional fields.
    See <scm|bib-db.scm> for examples.

    <item*|<scm|db-encoding-table>>For each triple <scm|(attr type enc)> of
    an attribute, an entry type and an encoding scheme, specify a keywords
    which specifies how to encode/decode field values. The two possible
    values implemented in <scm|db-format.scm> are <scm|:identity> and
    <scm|:texmacs>.

    <item*|<scm|db-encoder-table>, <scm|db-decoder-table>> For the keyword
    values in <scm|db-encoding-table>, specify the actual routines to be used
    for encoding and decoding.
  </description>

  <paragraph|Macros for context specification>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(with-encoding enc . body)><explain-synopsis|specify
    encoding/decoding scheme>
  <|explain>
    Specify the encoding/decoding scheme <scm|enc> to be used inside
    <scm|body>. This value is used as the third component of triples in
    <scm|db-encoding-table>. Implemented encoding/decoding schemes are
    <scm|#f> (no encoding/decoding) and <scm|:default>.
  </explain>

  <paragraph|Special attributes>

  <\description>
    <item*|<scm|type>>Specifies the entry type.
  </description>

  <paragraph|Affected routines of the database API>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-set-field id attr vals)><explain-synopsis|set values for a given
    field>

    <scm|(db-get-field id attr)><explain-synopsis|get all values for a given
    field>

    <scm|(db-set-entry id l)><explain-synopsis|fill out a complete entry>

    <scm|(db-get-entry id)><explain-synopsis|retrieve a complete entry>

    <scm|(db-remove-entry id)><explain-synopsis|remove a complete entry>

    <scm|(db-search q)><explain-synopsis|search for a list of fields>
  <|explain>
    The default behaviour is customized so as to encode/decode field values
    according to the current encoding/decoding scheme.

  <tmdoc-title|Typing large delimiters>

  Brackets inside mathematical formulas should always match: as soon as you
  enter an opening bracket ``(<math|>'', <TeXmacs> will automatically insert
  the matching closing bracket ``<math|>)''. You may disable this feature
  using <menu|Edit|Preferences|Keyboard|Automatic brackets|Disable>.
  Attention (see also below): brackets in old documents will be automatically
  be upgraded to matching brackets.

  Sometimes, you do not want the closing bracket, or you may want to replace
  it by another closing bracket. No problem: if your cursor is just before
  the closing bracket inside <math|<around|(|a,b<value|cursor>|)>>, then
  pressing<nbsp><key|]> will turn the expression into
  <math|<around|(|a,b|]><value|cursor>>. Alternatively, deletion of a bracket
  will actually turn it into an <hlink|invisible
  bracket|../semantics/man-semantics-symbols.en.tm#nobracket>, after which
  you can replace it by an arbitrary opening or closing bracket.

  By default, the sizes of the brackets are adjusted to the expression
  between the brackets. Small delimiters, which are created using the
  <prefix|math:small>-prefix, keep their sizes independently of the enclosed
  expression. Alternatively, you may use <shortcut|(alternate-toggle
  (focus-tree))> in order to toggle between large and small delimiters.

  For some delimiters, such as <math|\|>, the opening and closing delimiters
  coincide. For instance, entering a vertical bar <key|\|> will produce an
  absolute value. The (small) bar-separator <math|\|> is obtained using
  <shortcut|\|>, or as a variant using <key|\| var>. The big bar-separator is
  entered using <shortcut|(math-separator "\|" #t)>. In <TeX> and <LaTeX>,
  such large separators do not exist; they are used for producing the
  vertical bars in formulas like

  <\equation*>
    <around*|\<langle\>|<frac|a|b+c><mid|\|><frac|p|q+r><mid|\|><frac|a|b+c>|\<rangle\>>.
  </equation*>

  There may be as many middle delimiters between a left and a right delimiter
  as one wishes. Notice that there are still another number of variants of
  vertical bars. For instance, the binary relation ``divides'' is entered
  using <shortcut|\<divides\>> or <key|\| var var var var>.

  In <TeXmacs>, large delimiters may either be ``left delimiters'', ``right
  delimiters'' or ``middle delimiters''. By default, <math|(,[,{> and
  <math|\<langle\>> are left delimiters, <math|),],}> and <math|\<rangle\>>
  are right delimiters. But there status can be changed using the
  <prefix|math:left>, <prefix|math:right> and <prefix|math:middle> key
  combinations. For instance, <key|math:left )> produces <math|)>, considered
  as a large left delimiter.

  Sometimes you may want large delimiters of a particular size, instead of
  self-adjusting ones. This can be achieved by resizing the expression in
  between the brackets using the items in <menu|Format|Adjust>.

  Notice that it is possible to insert a pair of invisible brackets using
  <shortcut|(math-bracket-open "." "." #t)>. This is for instance useful in
  computational contexts, in which formulas should admit a precise, not
  merely visual semantics. Alternatively, one may put the formula inside a
  ``rigid box'' using<nbsp><shortcut|(make-rigid)>, which additionally
  prevents the formula from being hyphenated.

    <explain-macro|if|condition|if-body>

    <explain-macro|if|condition|if-body|else-body><explain-synopsis|conditional
    markup>
  <|explain>
    This primitive can be used to typeset <src-arg|if-body> only if the
    <src-arg|condition> is satisfied. If the optional <src-arg|else-body> is
    specified, then it is typeset if and only if the <src-arg|condition>
    fails.

    <\remark>
      It should be noticed that the use of conditional markup can be a bit
      tricky due to the fact that the accessability of arguments cannot
      necessarily be checked beforehand. For instance, in the macro
      definition

      <\tm-fragment>
        <inactive*|<macro|x|<if|<visibility-flag>|<arg|x>>>>
      </tm-fragment>

      the macro argument <src-arg|x> is accessible if and only if
      <inactive*|<visibility-flag>> evaluates to true. This condition cannot
      necessarily be checked <em|a priori>. For certain editing operations,
      like searches or spell checking, the incorrect determination of the
      accessability may lead to the positioning of the cursor at unaccessible
      places, or to the ignorance of certain markup. In the future, we plan
      to improve this aspect of the editor, but it is better to avoid
      conditional markup whenever another solution can be found.
    </remark>

    <\remark>
      The conditional constructs are only fully implemented for inline
      markup. In the case when you need conditional markup for block
      structures you currently have to write macros for the if-case and the
      else-case and use the <markup|compound> tag. For instance:

      <\tm-fragment>
        <inactive*|<assign|cold|<macro|x|<with|color|blue|<arg|x>>>>>

        <inactive*|<assign|hot|<macro|x|<with|color|red|<arg|x>>>>>

        <inactive*|<assign|adaptive|<macro|x|<compound|<if|<summer>|<value|hot>|<value|cold>>|<arg|x>>>>>
      </tm-fragment>
    </remark>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|case|cond-1|body-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|cond-n|body-n>

    <explain-macro|case|cond-1|body-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|cond-n|body-n|else-body><explain-synopsis|case
    distinction>
  <|explain>
    These commands are respectively equivalent to

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<if|<arg|cond-1>|<arg|body-1>|<active*|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>><if|<arg|cond-n>|<arg|body-n>>>>

      <inactive*|<if|<arg|cond-1>|<arg|body-1>|<active*|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>><if|<arg|cond-n>|<arg|body-n>|<arg|else-body>>>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|while|condition|body><explain-synopsis|repeated
    evaluation>
  <|explain>
    This construct maybe used in order to repeatly execute a given
    <src-arg|body> while a given <src-arg|condition> is satisfied. For
    instance, when declaring

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|count|<macro|from|to|<with|i|<arg|from>|<style-with|src-compact|none|<while|<less|<value|i>|<arg|to>>|<value|i>,
      <assign|i|<plus|<value|i>|1>>><arg|to>>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    the code <inactive*|<count|1|50>> produces

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|count|<macro|from|to|<with|i|<arg|from>|<while|<less|<value|i>|<arg|to>>|<value|i>,

  <tmdoc-title|Introduction>

  In this chapter we describe how to interface <TeXmacs> with an extern
  application. Such interfaces should be distributed in the form of
  <hyper-link|plugins|../plugin/plugins.en.tm>. The plug-in may either
  contain the extern application, or provide the ``glue'' between <TeXmacs>
  and the application. Usually, interfaces are used interactively in shell
  sessions (see <menu|Insert|Session>). But they may also be designed for
  background tasks, such as spell checking or typesetting.

  The communication between <TeXmacs> and the application takes place using a
  customizable input format and the special <em|<TeXmacs> meta-format> for
  output from the plug-in. The meta-format enables you to send structured
  output to <TeXmacs>, using any common format like <verbatim|verbatim>,
  <LaTeX>, <name|Postscript>, <name|HTML,> or <TeXmacs> itself. This is
  useful when adding a <TeXmacs> interface to an existing system, since
  <LaTeX> or <name|Postscript> output routines are often already implemented.
  It will then suffice to put the appropriate markers in order to make a
  first interface with <TeXmacs>.

  As soon as basic communication between your application and <TeXmacs> is
  working, you may improve the interface in many ways. Inside shell sessions,
  there is support for prompts, default inputs, tab-completion, mathematical
  and multi-line input, <abbr|etc.> In general, your application may take
  control of <TeXmacs> and modify the user interface (menus, keyboard,
  <abbr|etc.>) or add new <value|scheme> routines to <TeXmacs>. Your
  application may even extend the typesetter.

  In the directory <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/examples/plugins>, you can find
  many examples of simple plug-ins. In the next sections, we will give a more
  detailed explanation of the interfacing features of <TeXmacs> on the hand
  of these examples. In order to try one of these examples, we recall that
  you just have to copy it to either one of the directories

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/plugins

    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins
  </verbatim>

  and run the <verbatim|Makefile> (if there is one).

  <tmdoc-title|Version management>

  Sometimes, a new or better version for a database entry becomes available.
  This happens for instance, when the value of some field needs to be
  corrected, or when a paper in a bibliographic database gets published. In
  <scm|db-version.scm>, we introduce a few additional attributes and routines
  for version management of database entries.

  This is particularly important when entries are attached to files and
  automatically imported into the databases of other users. In this case, one
  must be careful to determine the most recent version (or versions) and only
  update entries when we are sure that the new version is better. In order to
  achieve this, we use the following principle: each entry comes with a main
  contributor and for each contributor, we only allow one most recent
  version. In addition, the current version of a first contributor may be
  declared to be ``newer'' than the current version of a second contributor.

  <paragraph|Special attributes>

  <\description>
    <item*|<scm|contributor>>Specifies the user who originally contributed
    the entry.

    <item*|<scm|modus>>Specifies the way the entry was contributed
    (<scm|manual> or <scm|imported>).

    <item*|<scm|origin>>A source file in the case when the entry was
    imported.

    <item*|<scm|newer>>Specifies a list of older versions of a given entry.
  </description>

  <paragraph|Useful routines>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-update-entry id l)><explain-synopsis|update an entry>
  <|explain>
    Create a new version of the entry with identifier <scm|id> (the new
    version having fields <scm|l>) and return the identifier of the new
    entry.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-import-entry id l)><explain-synopsis|import an entry>
  <|explain>
    Given an entry <scm|id> with fields <scm|l>, typically from another
    database, import the entry into our current database. Do the necessary
    whenever newer versions of this entry already exist in the database (in
    which case the import is cancelled), or whenever the entry supersedes
    existing entries.

  <tmdoc-title|Welcome to GNU <TeXmacs>>

  <section|How to get started>

  If you are new to <TeXmacs>, then you might first want to get some
  information on how to read the documentation. Click
  <hlink|here|../../main/start/man-conventions.en.tm> with your mouse in
  order to learn more about the conventions which are used throughout the
  documentation. You may search for words in the documentation by pressing
  <no-break><shortcut|(interactive docgrep-in-doc)>. Another important thing
  you might want to do is to <hlink|configure|../../main/config/man-configuration.en.tm>
  <TeXmacs> so that it will suit your needs best.

  <section|Information for general users>

  <\itemize>
    <item>In the <hlink|<menu|Help|Manual>|../../main/man-manual.en.tm> menu,
    you find the main documentation about how to use <TeXmacs>. The manual is
    quite complete, but not very detailed.

    <item>In the <hlink|<menu|Help|Reference
    guide>|../../main/man-reference.en.tm> menu, you find more detailed
    documentation about the <TeXmacs> format, its primitives and environment
    variables, and the standard style files.

    <item>In the <hlink|<menu|Help|Tutorial>|../../tutorial/tut-tutorial.en.tm>
    menu, we have started a <TeXmacs> tutorial. The tutorial is mainly
    intended for beginners, but the later chapters should also be useful for
    more experienced users. Unfortunately, the tutorial is not very complete
    yet.

    <item>The <hlink|<menu|Help|About>|../../about/about.en.tm> menu contains
    more information about <TeXmacs>, like information about its
    <hlink|authors|../../about/authors/authors.en.tm>, how to <hlink|contact
    us|../../about/authors/contact.en.tm>, and
    <hlink|changes|../../about/changes/changes.en.tm> in different versions
    of the program.

    <item>Documentation in the form of full books is also available in
    <menu|Help|full manuals>. In fact, you may compile such books yourself
    from any help page using <menu|Help|full manuals|Compile book>. This may
    take a few minutes though.
  </itemize>

  <section|Contribute to <TeXmacs>>

  One great thing about free software is that you may adapt the software to
  fit your own needs and share your experiences with others. In fact, this
  turns out to be far easier than most people think. Therefore you might wish
  to learn more about how to <hlink|contribute|../../about/contribute/contribute.en.tm>
  to the <TeXmacs> project. You can also make a
  <hlink|donation|../../about/contribute/material/donations.en.tm> to us.

  If you want to contribute to <TeXmacs>, or if you want to adapt the program
  for some particular purpose, then you will find more useful information in
  the <hlink|<menu|Help|Help us>|../contribute/contribute.en.tm> and
  <hlink|<menu|Help|Projects>|../projects/projects.en.tm> menus. In
  <hlink|<menu|Help|Interfacing>|../../devel/plugin/plugin.en.tm> it is
  explained how to interface <TeXmacs> with other systems. A part of the
  source code has also been documented in <hlink|<menu|Help|Source
  code>|../../devel/source/source.en.tm>.

  <tmdoc-title|Converters for Html and MathML>

  <paragraph|<name|Html generation>>

  <TeXmacs> supports reasonably good converters to <name|Html> and
  <name|MathML>. A document can be exported to <name|Html> using
  <menu|File|Export|Html>. <TeXmacs> makes moderate use of <name|Css> in
  order to improve the presentation of the generated <name|Html>.

  By default, <TeXmacs> does its best in order to render formulas using
  existing <name|Html>/<name|Css> primitives. When selecting
  <menu|Edit|Preferences|Converters|TeXmacs-\<gtr\>Html|Use MathML>, all
  formulas will be exported as <name|MathML>. Notice that this requires you
  to save the generated documents using the <verbatim|.xhtml> extension.

  Similarly, the user may force <TeXmacs> to export all mathematical formulas
  as images using <menu|Edit|Preferences|Converters|TeXmacs-\<gtr\>Html|Export
  formulas as images>. If your destination file is called
  <verbatim|name.html>, then the images are stored in the same directory in
  files <verbatim|name-1.png>, <rigid|<verbatim|name-2.png>> and so on. Even
  when formulas are not exported as images, notice that all graphics drawn
  using <TeXmacs> are exported in this way. In particular, the exportation of
  a <TeXmacs> file with pictures may give rise to the creation of additional
  image files. You may also force arbitrary content to be exported as an
  image using <menu|Format|Specific|Image>.

  <TeXmacs> also provides a facility for the creation of entire websites. For
  this, you just have to regroup the files for your website into a single
  directory. Using <menu|Tools|Web|Create website> you may now convert all
  <TeXmacs> files in this directory to <name|Html> files in a new directory.
  The conversion procedure recursively traverses all subdirectories and all
  non-<TeXmacs> files are simply copied.

  <paragraph|Customized <name|Html> generation>

  The following <TeXmacs> environment variables can be used to customize the
  <name|Html> generation:

  <\description>
    <item*|<src-var|html-title>>The title of your exported document.

    <item*|<src-var|html-css>>A cascaded style sheet for your exported
    document.

    <item*|<src-var|html-head-javascript-src>>An external <name|Javascript>
    file to be executed before the body.

    <item*|<src-var|html-head-javascript>>A <name|Javascript> script to be
    executed before the body.
  </description>

  You may also use the following macros:

  <\indent>
    <\explain|<explain-macro|html-div|class|body>>
      Associate a CSS class to the content <src-arg|body>.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|html-style|style|body>>
      Associate a CSS style to the content <src-arg|body>.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|html-javascript-src|src>>
      Execute a <name|Javascript> script from the file <src-arg|src>.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|html-javascript|code>>
      Execute the <name|Javascript> script <compound|src-arg|code>.
    </explain>
  </indent>

  <paragraph|Html importation>

  <TeXmacs> also contains a rudimentary input converter for <name|Html> in
  <menu|File|Import|Html>. Most of HTML 2.0 and parts of HTML 3.0 are
  currently supported. However, no browsing facilities have been added yet.
  The converter also contains a reasonably complete input converter for
  embedded <name|MathML> fragments.

  When importing HTML documents, files whose names start with
  <verbatim|http:> or <verbatim|ftp:> will be downloaded from the web using
  <verbatim|wget>. If you compiled <TeXmacs> yourself, then you can download
  <verbatim|wget> from\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/
  </verbatim>

  In the binary distributions, we have included <verbatim|wget>.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Lists>

  Using <apply|menu|Insert|Itemize> you may start an unnumbered list. You may
  either select a particular tag like <with|mode|math|\<bullet\>> (bullets),
  <with|mode|math|<op|->> (dashes) or <with|mode|math|<op|\<rightarrow\>>>
  (arrows) to indicate entries in the list or the default tag. Lists may be
  <em|nested> inside other tags, like in the following list:

  <\itemize>
    <item>First item.

    <item>Now comes the sublist:

    <\itemize>
      <item>A subitem.

      <item>Another one.
    </itemize>

    <item>A final item.
  </itemize>

  The default tag is rendered in a different way depending on the level of
  nesting. At the outermost level, we used the <with|mode|math|\<bullet\>>
  tag, at the second level <with|mode|math|<op|\<circ\>>>, and so on. When
  you are inside a list, notice that pressing <shortcut|(kbd-return)>
  automatically starts a new item. If you need items which are several
  paragraphs long, then you may always use <shortcut|(kbd-shift-return)> in
  order to start a new paragraph.

  Enumerate environments, which are started using
  <apply|menu|Insert|Enumerate>, behave in a similar way as itemize, except
  that the items are numbered. Here follows an example of an enumeration
  which was started using <apply|menu|Insert|Enumerate|Roman>:

  <\expand|enumerate-Roman>
    <item>A first item.

    <item>A second one.

    <item>And a last one.
  </expand>

  The last type of lists are descriptive lists. They are started using
  <apply|menu|Insert|Description> and allow you to describe a list of concepts:

  <\description>
    <expand|item*|Gnu.>A hairy but gentle beast.

    <expand|item*|Gnat.>Only lives in a zoo.

  <tmdoc-title|Typing mathematical symbols>

  The Greek characters are obtained in <TeXmacs> using the
  <prefix|math:greek>-key. For instance, <key|math:greek a>
  yields<nbsp><math|\<alpha\>> and <key|math:greek G> yields
  <math|\<Gamma\>>. Similarly, <prefix|math:bold>, <prefix|math:cal>,
  <prefix|math:frak> and <prefix|math:bbb> can be used in order to type bold,
  calligraphic, fraktur and blackboard bold characters. For instance,
  <shortcut|\<frak-m\>> yields<nbsp><math|\<frak-m\>>, <key|S-F6 R>
  yields<nbsp><math|\<bbb-R\>> and <shortcut|\<b-cal-Z\>> yields
  <math|\<b-cal-Z\>>.

  Greek characters can also be obtained as ``variants'' of Latin characters
  using the <key|var>-key. For instance, <key|p var> yields <math|\<pi\>>.
  The <key|var>-key is also used for obtaining variants of the Greek letters
  themselves. For instance, both <key|math:greek p var> and <key|p var var>
  yield <math|\<varpi\>>. An alternative way to enter blackboard bold
  characters is to type the same capital twice. For instance, <key|Z Z>
  yields<nbsp><math|\<bbb-Z\>>.

  Some symbols admit many variants. For instance, <key|\<less\>> yields
  <math|\<less\>>, <key|\<less\> var> yields <math|\<in\>>, <key|\<less\> var
  var> yields <math|\<subset\>>, <key|\<less\> var var var> yields
  <math|\<prec\>>, and so on. You may ``cycle back'' among the variants
  using<nbsp><key|S-var>. For instance, <key|\<less\> var var S-var> is
  equivalent to <key|\<less\> var>.

  Many other mathematical symbols are obtained by ``natural''
  key-combinations. For instance, <key|- \<gtr\>> yields
  <math|<op|\<rightarrow\>>>, <key|- - \<gtr\>> yields
  <math|<op|\<longrightarrow\>>> and <key|\<gtr\> => yields
  <math|<op|\<geqslant\>>>. Similarly, <key|\| var -> yields
  <math|<op|\<vdash\>>>, <key|\| - \<gtr\>> yields <math|<op|\<mapsto\>>> and
  <key|- \<gtr\> \<less\> -> yields <math|<op|\<rightleftarrows\>>>. The
  following general rules hold in order to enter mathematical symbols:

  <\description>
    <item*|<key|tab>>is the main key for obtaining variants. For instance,
    <key|\<gtr\> => yields <math|<op|\<geqslant\>>>, but <key|\<gtr\> = var>
    yields<nbsp><math|<op|\<geq\>>>. Similarly, <key|\<less\> var var> yields
    <math|<op|\<subset\>>>, <key|\<less\> var var => yields
    <math|<op|\<subseteq\>>> and <key|\<less\> var var = var> yields
    <math|<op|\<subseteqq\>>>. Also, <key|P var> yields<nbsp><math|\<wp\>>
    and <key|e var> yields the constant <math|\<mathe\>=exp<around|(|1|)>>.

    <item*|<key|@>>is used for putting symbols into circles or boxes. For
    instance, <key|@ +> yields <math|<op|\<oplus\>>> and <key|@ x> yields
    <math|<op|\<otimes\>>>. Similarly, <key|@ var +> yields
    <math|<op|\<boxplus\>>>.

    <item*|<key|/>>is used for negations. For instance, <key|= /> yields
    <math|<op|\<neq\>>> and <key|\<less\> = /> yields
    <math|<neg|\<leqslant\>>>. Notice that <key|\<less\> = var var /> yields
    <math|<op|\<nleqq\>>>, while <key|\<less\> = var var / var> yields
    <math|<op|\<lneqq\>>>.

    <item*|<key|!>>is used after arrows in order to force scripts to be
    placed above or below the arrow. For instance, <key|- - \<gtr\> ^ x>
    yields <math|<op|\<longrightarrow\><rsup|x> >>, but <key|- - \<gtr\> ! ^
    x> yields <math|\<longrightarrowlim\><rsup|x>>.
  </description>

  The logical relations <math|\<wedge\>> and <math|\<vee\>> are obtained
  using <key|&> and <key|%>. The operators <math|\<cap\>> and <math|\<cup\>>
  are natural variants <key|& var> and <key|% var>. Various miscellaneous
  symbols can be optained using the <prefix|math:symbol> prefix.

  Notice that certain symbols with a different mathematical meaning are
  sometimes denoted in a<nbsp>similar way; such symbols are called
  <em|homoglyphs>. For instance, the vertical bar <math|\|> can be used as
  a<nbsp>separator for defining sets <math|R<rsup|\<gtr\>>=<around*|{|x\<in\>R\|x\<gtr\>0|}>>,
  but also as the binary relation ``divides''<nbsp><rigid|<math|11\<divides\>1001>>.
  Often, but not always, homoglyphs admit a different spacing. The most
  annoying ambiguity is between invisible multiplication <math|x*y> and
  function application <math|sin x>, which are entered using the shortcuts
  <key|*> <abbr|resp.> <key|space>.

  In order to facilitate certain automated treatments of your documents, such
  as mathematical syntax checking, we incite authors to pay attention to the
  homoglyph problem when entering formulas. For more information on this
  issue and how <TeXmacs> can assist you to use the appropriate notations, we
  refer to our section on the <hlink|semantics of mathematical
  symbols|../semantics/man-semantics-symbols.en.tm>.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Undo and redo>

  It is possible to gradually undo the changes you made in a document from
  the moment that you launched <apply|TeXmacs>. This can be done via
  <submenu|Edit|undo> or using the keystrokes <shortcut|(undo 0)> or
  <shortcut|(undo 0)>. Undone changes can be ``redone'' using <submenu|Edit|redo> or
  <shortcut|(redo 0)>.

  In order to save memory, the number of successive actions which can be
  undone is limited to 100 (by default). It is possible to increase this
  number by adding a command like\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ (set-maximal-undo-depth 1000)
  </verbatim>

  in our personal initialization file (see <submenu|Help|scheme>). When
  specifying a negative number as your maximal undo depth, any number of
  actions can be undone.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Why freedom is important for scientists>

  One major objective of <TeXmacs> is to promote the development of free
  software for and by scientists, by significantly reducing the cost of
  producing high quality user interfaces. If you plan to write an interface
  between <apply|TeXmacs> and other software, then please contact us.

  As a mathematician, I am deeply convinced that only free programs are
  acceptable from a scientific point of view. I see two main reasons for
  this:

  <\itemize>
    <item>A result computed by a ``mathematical'' system, whose source code
    is not public, can not be accepted as part of a mathematical proof.

    <item>Just as a mathematician should be able to build theorems on top of
    other theorems, it should be possible to freely modify and release
    algorithms of mathematical software.
  </itemize>

  However, it is strange, and a shame, that the main mathematical programs
  which are currently being used are proprietary. The main reason for this is
  that mathematicians often do not consider programming as a full scientific
  activity. Consequently, the development of useful software is delegated to
  ``engineers'' and the resulting programs are used as black boxes.

  This subdivision of scientific activity is very artificial: it is often
  very important from a scientific point of view to know what there is in the
  black box. Inversely, deep scientific understanding usually leads to the
  production of better software. Consequently, I think that scientists should
  advocate the development of software as a full scientific activity,
  comparable to writing articles. Then it is clear too that such software
  should be diffused in a way which is compatible with the requirements of
  science: public availability, reproducibility and free usability.

  Documentation for <TeXmacs> internal features and API is typically written

  reading the manual as a book. However it often happens that some <scheme>
  module or procedure needs documenting but doesn't fit into any of the
  available sections of the manual. The purpose of this section is precisely
  to assemble all those pieces of information. Currently (sept. 2013) there
  are very sketchy pages for:

  <tmdoc-title|Customizing sectional tags>

  By default, <TeXmacs> provides the standard sectional tags from <LaTeX>
  <markup|part>, <markup|chapter>, <markup|section>, <markup|subsection>,
  <markup|subsubsection>, <markup|paragraph>, <markup|subparagraph>, as well
  as the special tag <markup|appendix>. <TeXmacs> also implements the
  unnumbered variants <markup|part*>, <markup|chapter*>, <abbr|etc.> and
  special section-like tags <markup|bibliography>,
  <markup|table-of-contents>, <markup|the-index>, <markup|the-glossary>,
  <markup|list-of-figures>, <markup|list-of-tables>.

  <\remark>
    <label|section-extra-argument-rem>Currently, the sectional tags take one
    argument, the section title, but a second argument with the body of the
    section is planned to be inserted in the future (see the experimental
    <tmpackage|structured-section> package). For this reason (among others),
    style files should never redefine the main sectional tags, but rather
    customize special macros which have been provided to this effect.
  </remark>

  From a global point of view, an important predicate macro is
  <markup|sectional-short-style>. When it evaluates to <verbatim|true>, then
  appendices, tables of contents, <abbr|etc.> are considered to be at the
  same level as sections. In the contrary case, they are at the same level as
  chapters. Typically, articles use the short sectional style whereas book
  use the long style.

  The rendering of a sectional tag <markup|<em|x>> is controlled through the
  macros <markup|<em|x>-sep>, <markup|<em|x>-title> and
  <markup|<em|x>-numbered-title>. The <markup|<em|x>-sep> macro prints the
  separator between the section number and the section title. It defaults to
  the macro <markup|sectional-sep>, which defaults in its turn to a wide
  space. For instance, after redefining

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|sectional-sep|<macro| -- >>>
  </tm-fragment>

  sectional titles would typically look like

  <\tm-fragment>
    <with|section-nr|1|sectional-sep|<macro| --
    >|<section-numbered-title|Hairy GNUs>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <markup|<em|x>-title> and <markup|<em|x>-numbered-title> macros
  respectively specify how to render unnumbered and numbered section titles.
  Usually, the user only needs to modify <markup|<em|x>-title>, since
  <markup|<em|x>-numbered-title> is based on <markup|<em|x>-title>. However,
  if the numbers have to be rendered in a particular way, then it may be
  necessary to redefine <markup|<em|x>-numbered-title>. For instance,
  consider the redefinition

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|subsection-numbered-title|<macro|name|<style-with|src-compact|none|<sectional-normal|<with|font-series|bold|<the-subsection>.
    ><arg|name>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  This has the following effect on the rendering of subsection titles:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <with|section-nr|2|subsection-nr|3|the-subsection|<macro|<value|section-nr>.<value|subsection-nr>>|subsection-numbered-title|<macro|name|<sectional-normal|<with|font-series|bold|<the-subsection>.
    ><arg|name>>>|<subsection-numbered-title|Very hairy GNUs>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Notice that the <tmpackage|section-base> package provides several
  <hyper-link|useful helper macros|../../../main/styles/section/section-base-helper.en.tm>
  like <markup|sectional-normal>.

  <\remark>
    Sectional titles can either be rendered in a ``short'' or in the ``long''
    fashion. By default, paragraphs and subparagraphs use the short
    rendering, for which the body starts immediately at the right of the
    title:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <paragraph-title|My paragraph>Blah, blah, and more blahs...
    </tm-fragment>

    All other sectional tags use the long rendering, in which case the
    section title takes a separate line on its own:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <section-title|My section>

      Blah, blah, and more blahs...
    </tm-fragment>

    We do not recommend to modify the standard settings (<abbr|i.e.> to
    render paragraphs in a long way or sections in a short way). If you
    really want to do so, then we recommend to redefine the corresponding
    environment variables <inactive|<value|enrich-x-long>>. This will ensure
    upward compatibility when sectional tags will take an additional argument
    (see remark <reference|section-extra-argument-rem>).
  </remark>

  Besides their rendering, several other aspects of sectional tags can be
  customized:

  <\itemize>
    <item>The call-back macro <markup|<em|x>-clean> can be used for cleaning
    some counters when a new section is started. For instance, in order to
    prefix all standard environments by the section counter, you may use the
    following lines:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\inactive*>
        <assign|section-clean|<macro|<reset-subsection><reset-std-env>>>

        <assign|display-std-env|<macro|nr|<section-prefix><arg|nr>>>
      </inactive*>
    </tm-fragment>

    <item>The call-back macro <markup|<em|x>-header> should be used in order
    to modify page headers and footers when a new section is started.
    Typically, this macro should call <markup|header-primary>, or
    <markup|header-secondary>, or do nothing.

    <item>The call-back macro <markup|<em|x>-toc> should be used in order to
    customize the way new sections appear in the table of contents.
  </itemize>

  <tmdoc-title|Typing structured text>

  Usually, long documents have a structure: they are organized in chapters,
  sections and subsections, they contain different types of text, such as
  regular text, citations, footnotes, theorems, etc. After selecting a
  <def-index|document style> in <menu|Document|Style>, <TeXmacs> takes care
  of specific layout issues, such as numbering of sections, pages, theorems,
  typesetting citations and footnotes in a nice way and so on.

  Currently, several standard document styles have been implemented:
  <tmstyle|generic>, <tmstyle|article>, <tmstyle|book>, <tmstyle|letter>,
  <tmstyle|exam>, <tmstyle|beamer>, <tmstyle|seminar>, <tmstyle|source>. For
  instance, the article style can be used for writing articles. Besides,
  there are styles for common journals and special purposes, such as the
  <TeXmacs> documentation.

  As soon as you have selected a document style, you can organize your text
  into sections (see <menu|Insert|Section>) and use specific
  <def-index|environments> (also called <em|tags>). Examples of environments
  are theorem, proposition, remark and so on (see <menu|Insert|Enunciation>).
  Other examples are lists of items (see <menu|Insert|Itemize>) or numbered
  lists (see <menu|Insert|Enumerate>). Further examples of frequently used
  tags are <markup|strong> (for writing ``important'' text), <markup|name>
  (for writing names of persons), etc.

  When you get more acquainted with <TeXmacs>, it is possible to add your own
  new environments in your own style file. Assume for instance that you often
  make citations and that you want those to appear in italic, with left and
  right margins of 1cm. Instead of manually changing the text and paragraph
  properties each time you make a citation, it is better to create a citation
  environment. Not only it will be faster to create a new citation when doing
  so, but it is also possible to systematically change the layout of your
  citations throughout the document just by changing the definition of the
  citation environment. The latter situation occurs for instance if you
  discover <with|font-shape|italic|a posteriori> that you prefer the
  citations to appear in a smaller font.

  There are a few general editing principles which make it easy to manipulate
  structured documents using <TeXmacs>. One major concept is the <em|current
  focus>, which is best illustrated on an example. Assume that we are in the
  process of entering a classical theorem:

  <\quote-env>
    The following theorem is due to <name|Euler>:

    <\big-envbox>
      <\theorem>
        <small-focus|<math|\<mathe\><rsup|\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>>=\<um\>1<value|math-cursor>>>.
      </theorem>
    </big-envbox>
  </quote-env>

  At the position of the cursor, the grey and cyan boxes indicate the active
  tags: in this case, the cursor is both inside a theorem and a formula. The
  innermost active tag (the formula <math|\<mathe\><rsup|\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>>=\<um\>1>
  in our example) is surrounded by a cyan box and called the <em|current
  focus>.

  The contents of the <menu|Focus> menu and <em|focus toolbar> (the lowest
  toolbar) are highly context dependent and determined as a function of the
  current focus. In our example, the focus toolbar contains a<nbsp>popup menu
  button <menu|Formula>; when selecting <menu|Equation> in this menu, the
  text will change into

  <\quote-env>
    The following theorem is due to <name|Euler>:

    <\big-envbox>
      <\theorem>
        \;

        <\big-focus>
          <\equation*>
            \<mathe\><rsup|\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>>=\<um\>1<value|math-cursor>.
          </equation*>
        </big-focus>
      </theorem>
    </big-envbox>
  </quote-env>

  Similarly, the arrow buttons on the left hand side of the focus toolbar
  allow you to jump to similar tags. In this case, they will allow you to
  quickly traverse all formulas and equations in your document. For more
  information on ``<hlink|structured editing
  operations|../editing/man-structured-editing.en.tm>'' we refer to the
  chapter on <hlink|editing tools|../editing/man-editing-tools.en.tm>.

  A second important concept is the <em|current editing mode>. Currently,
  there are five major modes: text mode, mathematics mode, program mode,
  graphics mode and source mode. In principle, the current mode can be
  determined from the current focus, but the mode is likely to change less
  often than the focus. The <em|mode dependent toolbar> above the focus
  toolbar contains several buttons which are useful in the current mode. The
  contents of the <menu|Insert> and <menu|Format> menus are also mode
  dependent.

  <tmdoc-title|Linking primitives>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|label|name><explain-synopsis|reference target>
  <|explain>
    The operand must evaluate to a literal string, it is used as a target
    name which can be referred to by <markup|reference>, <markup|pageref> and
    <markup|hlink> tags.

    Label names should be unique in a document and in a project.

    Examples in this section will make references to an example
    <markup|label> named ``there''.

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<label|there>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|reference|name><explain-synopsis|reference to a name>
  <|explain>
    The operand must evaluate to a literal string, which is the name of a
    <markup|label> defined in the current document or in another document of
    the current project.

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<reference|there>>
    </tm-fragment>

    The <markup|reference> is typeset as the value of the variable
    <src-var|the-label> at the point of the target <markup|label>. The
    <src-var|the-label> variable is set by many numbered structures:
    sections, figures, numbered equations, <no-break>etc.

    A <markup|reference> reacts to mouse clicks as an hyperlink.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|pageref|name><explain-synopsis|page reference to a name>
  <|explain>
    The operand must evaluate to a literal string, which is the name of a
    <markup|label> defined in the current document or in another document of
    the current project.

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<pageref|there>>
    </tm-fragment>

    The <markup|><markup|pageref> is typeset as the number of the page
    containing the target <markup|label>. Note that page numbers are only
    computed when the document is typeset with page-breaking, that is not in
    ``automatic'' or ``papyrus'' page type.

    A <markup|pageref> reacts to mouse clicks as an hyperlink.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|hlink|content|url><explain-synopsis|inline hyperlink>
  <|explain>
    This primitive produces an hyperlink with the visible text
    <src-arg|content> pointing to <src-arg|url>. The <src-arg|content> is
    typeset as inline <src-arg|url>. The <src-arg|url> must evaluate to a
    literal string in <abbr|URL> syntax and can point to local or remote
    documents, positions inside documents can be be specified with labels.

    The following examples are typeset as hyperlinks pointing to the label
    ``there'', respectively in the same document, in a document in the same
    directory, and on the web.

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<hlink|same document|#there>>

      <inactive*|<hlink|same directory|file.tm#there>>

      <inactive*|<hlink|on the web|http://example.org/#there>>
    </tm-fragment>

    If the document is not editable, the hyperlink is traversed by a simple
    click, if the document is editable, a double-click is required.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|include|url><explain-synopsis|include another document>
  <|explain>
    The operand must be a literal string and is interpreted as a file name.
    The content of this file is typeset in place of the <markup|include> tag,
    which must be placed in <re-index|block context>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|action|content|script><explain-synopsis|attach an action
    to content>
  <|explain>
    Bind a <scheme> <src-arg|script> to a double mouse click on
    <src-arg|content>. For instance, when clicking <action|here|(lambda ()
    (system "xterm &"))>, you may launch an <verbatim|xterm>. This action is
    encoded by

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<action|here|(lambda () (system "xterm &"))>>
    </tm-fragment>

    When clicking on actions, the user is usually prompted for confirmation,
    so as to avoid security problems. The user may control the desired level
    of security in <menu|Edit|Preferences|Security>. Programmers may also
    declare certain <scheme> routines to be ``secure''. <scheme> programs
    which only use secure routines are executed without confirmation from the
    user.

  <tmdoc-title|Customized mathematical semantics>

  We have done our best to support most of the classical mathematical
  notations. Nevertheless, the user may sometimes want to define notations
  with a non standard semantics. Certain areas may also require special
  notations which are not supported by default.

  <TeXmacs> provides a very simple <markup|syntax> primitive, which allows
  the user to manually override the default syntactical semantics of a
  formula. Assuming that semantic editing was activated, you may insert the
  <markup|syntax> primitive using <shortcut|(make 'syntax)> or
  <menu|Insert|Semantics|Other>. The first argument contains the formula as
  it should be displayed, whereas the second argument contains the formula as
  it should be interpreted.

  For instance, if we enter <math|\<cal-R\>> as the first argument and
  <math|\<less\>> as the second one, then the <math|\<cal-R\>> will be
  interpreted as a binary relation, exactly in the same way as
  <math|\<less\>>. Moreover, the spacing around <math|\<cal-R\>> will be
  adapted, so as to mimick the spacing around <math|\<less\>>. In this
  particular example, we might have obtained the same result by using the
  <markup|math-relation> primitive, which is equivalent to <markup|syntax>
  with<nbsp><math|\<less\>> as its second argument. Most standard operator
  types are available from <menu|Insert|Semantics>, or using the
  <prefix|math:syntax> keyboard prefix. In particular, you may use
  <shortcut|(make 'math-ignore)> to simply ignore a formula and
  <shortcut|(make 'math-ordinary)> in order to make the formula behave as an
  ordinary symbol (such as the letter ``o'').

  The <markup|syntax> primitive is especially powerful when used in
  combination with the <TeXmacs> macro language. For instance, consider the
  formula <math|C=1/2*\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>*<big-around|\<oint\>|f<around*|(|z|)>*\<mathd\>
  z>>. It is likely that the inteded interpretation of
  <math|1/2*\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>> is <math|1/<around*|(|2*\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>|)>>
  and not <math|<around*|(|1/2|)>*\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>>. Therefore, if we
  often use the constant <math|2*\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>>, then we might want to
  define a macro<nbsp><markup|twopii> by

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive|<assign|twopii|<inactive|<macro|<inactive|<syntax|<math|2*\<pi\>*\<mathi\>>|<math|(2*\<pi\>*\<mathi\>)>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Such macros may be grouped together into a style package with the user's
  favourite notations. Future versions of <TeXmacs> might also provide style
  packages with notations dedicated to specific<nbsp>areas.

  Let us finally notice that there are usually several ways for redefining
  the semantics of a formula. For instance, an alternative way to define the
  macro <markup|twopii> is using

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive|<assign|twopii|<inactive|<macro|<math|<around*|\<nobracket\>|2*\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>|\<nobracket\>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  where we inserted a pair of invisible brackets around
  <math|2*\<mathpi\>*\<mathi\>>. Similarly, in the formula

  <\equation*>
    \<mathe\><rsup|<sqrt|x>+\<mathe\><rsup|<sqrt|log
    x>+\<mathe\><rsup|<sqrt|log log x>+<math-ordinary|\<udots\>\<ddots\>>+log
    log log x>+log log x>+log x>,
  </equation*>

  we may either select the whole formula and give it the semantics of an
  ordinary symbol, by pressing<nbsp><shortcut|(make 'math-ordinary)>.
  However, a nicer solution is to only select the subformula
  <math|<math-ordinary|\<udots\>\<ddots\>>>, and give it the semantics of an
  ordinary symbol. Yet another example is the sign sequence <math|++-+-+>
  mentioned earlier. This sequence can be interpreted correctly by inserting
  invisible separators between the different signs using the <key|, space>
  shortcut.

  <tmdoc-title|Selecting the input method>

  By default, <TeXmacs> will attempt to evaluate the input field when
  pressing <key|return>. Multiline input can be created using <key|S-return>.
  Alternatively, when selecting the multiline input mode using
  <menu|Session|Input mode|Multiline input>, the <key|return> key will behave
  as usual and <key|S-return> may be used in order to evaluate the input
  field. Notice finally that certain systems admit built-in heuristics for
  testing whether the input has been completed; if not, then the <key|return>
  may behave as usual.

  Certain applications allow you to type the mathematical input in a
  graphical, two dimensional form. This feature can be used by selecting
  <menu|Session|Input mode|Mathematical input>. If this feature is available,
  then it is usually also possible to copy and paste output back into the
  input. However, it depends on the particular application how well this
  works. Keep in mind that some key combinations may be used by the
  <subsubmenu|Session|Input|Mathematical input> mode: for instance the key
  <key|$> is usually redefined inside math mode, so if you want to input it
  you'll have to type <key|S-F5><key|$>. You can read more about the prefix
  key <key|S-F5> in ``<hlink|Keyboard shortcuts fot text
  mode|../text/keyboard/man-text-kbd.en.tm>''.

<TeXmacs|1.0.4>

<style|tmdoc>

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|<TeXmacs> trees>

  All <TeXmacs> documents or document fragments can be thought of as
  <em|trees>. For instance, the tree

  <\equation*>
    <tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|with>>|mode|math|<tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|concat>>|x+y+|<tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|frac>>|1|2>|+|<tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|sqrt>>|y+z>>>
  </equation*>

  typically represents the formula

  <\equation>
    <label|tm-tree-ex>x+y+<frac|1|2>+<sqrt|y+z>
  </equation>

  <paragraph*|Internal nodes of <TeXmacs> trees>

  Each of the internal nodes of a <TeXmacs> tree is a string symbol and each
  of the leafs is an ordinary string. A string symbol is different from a
  usual string only from the efficiency point of view: <TeXmacs> represents
  each symbol by a unique number, so that it is extremely fast to test
  weather two symbols are equal.

  <paragraph*|Leafs of <TeXmacs> trees>

  Currently, all strings are represented using the <em|universal <TeXmacs>
  encoding>. This encoding coincides with the Cork font encoding for all
  characters except ``<verbatim|\<less\>>'' and ``<verbatim|\<gtr\>>''.
  Character sequences starting with ``<verbatim|\<less\>>'' and ending with
  ``<verbatim|\<gtr\>>'' are interpreted as special extension characters. For
  example, <verbatim|\<less\>alpha\<gtr\>> stands for the letter
  <with|mode|math|\<alpha\>>. The semantics of characters in the universal
  <TeXmacs> encoding does not depend on the context (currently, cyrillic
  characters are an exception, but this should change soon). In other words,
  the universal <TeXmacs> encoding may be seen as an analogue of Unicode. In
  the future, we might actually switch to Unicode.

  The string leafs either contain ordinary text or special data. <TeXmacs>
  supports the following atomic data types:

  <\description>
    <item*|Boolean numbers>Either <verbatim|true> or <verbatim|false>.

    <item*|Integers>Sequences of digits which may be preceded by a minus
    sign.

    <item*|Floating point numbers>Specified using the usual scientific
    notation.

    <item*|Lengths>Floating point numbers followed by a <hyper-link|length
    unit|lengths.en.tm>, like <verbatim|29.7cm> or <verbatim|2fn>.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Serialization and preferred syntax for editing>

  When storing a document as a file on your harddisk or when copying a
  document fragment to the clipboard, <TeXmacs> trees have to be represented
  as strings. The conversion without loss of information of abstract
  <TeXmacs> trees into strings is called <em|serialization> and the inverse
  process <em|parsing>. <TeXmacs> provides three ways to serialize trees,
  which correspond to the standard <hyper-link|<TeXmacs> format|tm-tm.en.tm>,
  the <hyper-link|XML format|tm-tmml.en.tm> and the
  <hyper-link|<value|scheme> format|tm-scm.en.tm>.

  However, it should be emphasized that the preferred syntax for modifying
  <TeXmacs> documents is the screen display inside the editor. If that seems
  surprising to you, consider that a syntax is a way to represent information
  in a form suitable to understanding and modification. The on-screen typeset
  representation of a document, together with its interactive behaviour, is a
  particularly concrete syntax. Moreover, in the <menu|Document|Source> menu,
  you may find different ways to customize the way documents are viewed, such
  as different levels of informative flags and a <hyper-link|``source tree''
  mode|../../style/presentation/src-present.en.tm> for editing style files.

  We are making it easier for users to edit style sheets. This improvement
  made it necessary to simplify many of the standard <TeXmacs> styles and

  already designed some style files, then this may break some of their
  features. We mainly redesigned the list environments, the section
  environments and automatic numbering. Please report any problems to us.

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Macro expansion (1.0.2.3 -- 1.0.2.7)>

  An important internal change concerning the data format has been made:
  macro expansions and function applications like

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (expand <em|tag> <em|arg-1> ... <em|arg-n>)
  </scheme-fragment>

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (apply <em|tag> <em|arg-1> ... <em|arg-n>)
  </scheme-fragment>

  are now replaced by hard-coded tags

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (<em|tag> <em|arg-1> ... <em|arg-n>)
  </scheme-fragment>

  Moreover, functions have systematically been replaced by macros. The few
  built-in functions which may take an arbitrary number of arguments have
  been rewritten using the new <markup|xmacro> construct. If you ever wrote
  such a function yourself, then you will need to rewrite it too.

  The new approach favorites a uniform treatment of macros and functions and
  makes the internal representation match with the corresponding
  <name|Scheme> representation. More and more information about tags will
  gradually be stored in the <abbr|D.R.D.> (Data Relation Definition). This
  information is mostly determined automatically using heuristics.

  Notice that some perverse errors might arise because of the above changes.
  Please keep copies of your old files and report any suspicious behaviour to
  us.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Formatting tags (1.0.2 -- 1.0.2.1)>

  All formattings constructs without arguments (like line breaks, indentation
  directives, etc.) have been replaced by tags of arity zero. This makes most
  new documents badly unreadable for older versions of <TeXmacs> and subtle
  errors might occasionnaly occur when saving or loading, or during other

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Keyboard (1.0.0.11 -- 1.0.1)>

  The <apply|TeXmacs> keybindings have been rationalized. Here follows a list
  of the major changes:

  <\itemize>
    <item>The <key|E-> prefix has been renamed to <prefix|M->.

    <item><key|escape> is equivalent to <prefix|M-> and
    <key|escape>-<key|escape> to <prefix|A->.

    <item>Mode dependent commands are now prefixed by <prefix|A->. In
    particular, accents are typed using <prefix|A-> instead of <key|E->.

    <item>Variants are now obtained using <key|tab> instead of
    <key|*> and you can circle back using
    <key|S-tab>.

    <item>Greek characters are now typed using <prefix|A-C->, <prefix|math:greek>, or the
    hyper modifier, which can be configured in
    <samp|Edit><with|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>><samp|Preferences>. You may
    also obtain Greek characters as variants of Latin characters. For
    instance, <key|p tab> yields <with|mode|math|\<pi\>>.

    <item>The signification of the cursor keys in combination with control,
    alt and meta has changed.
  </itemize>

  You may choose between several ``look and feels'' for the keyboard
  behaviour in <samp|Edit><with|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>><samp|Preferences><w\
  ith|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>><samp|Look and feel>. The default is
  <samp|Emacs>, but you may choose <samp|Old style> if you want to keep the
  behaviour to which you may be used now.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Style files (1.0.0.4)>

  Many changes have been made in the organization of the <apply|TeXmacs>
  style files. Personal style files which depend on intermediate
  <apply|TeXmacs> packages may require some slight adaptations.

  We are working towards a stabilization of the standard style files and
  packages. At the end of this process, it should be easy to adapt existing
  <apply|LaTeX> style files for journals to <apply|TeXmacs> by customizing
  these standard style files and packages. As soon as we have time, we plan
  to provide online documentation on how to do this at
  <samp|Help><with|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>><samp|Online documentation>.

  The way tabular material is treated has completely changed. It has become
  much easier to edit tables, matrices, equation arrays, etc. Also, many new
  features have been implemented, such as background color, border, padding,
  hyphenation, subtables, etc. However, the upgrading of old tabular material
  might sometimes be erroneous, in which case we invite you to submit a bug
  report.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Document format (0.3.4)>

  The TeXmacs document format has profoundly changed in order to make TeXmacs
  compatible with XML in the future. Most importantly, the old style
  environments like\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ \<less\>assign\|env\|\<less\>environment\|open\|close\<gtr\>\<gtr\
    \>,
  </verbatim>

  which are applied via matching pairs <verbatim|\<less\>begin\|env\<gtr\>tex\
  t\<less\>end\|env\<gtr\>>, have been replaced by macros\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ \<less\>assign\|env\|\<less\>macro\|body\|open\<less\>body\<gtr\>\
    close\<gtr\>\<gtr\>,
  </verbatim>

  which are applied via single macro expansions
  <verbatim|\<less\>expand\|env\|text\<gtr\>>. Similarly, matching pairs
  <verbatim|\<less\>set\|var\|val\<gtr\>text\<less\>reset\|var\<gtr\>> of
  environment variable changes are replaced by a
  <verbatim|\<less\>with\|var\|val\|text\<gtr\>> construct (close to XML
  attributes). From a technical point of view, these changes lead to several
  complications if the <verbatim|text> body consists of several paragraphs.
  As a consequence, badly structured documents may sometimes display
  differently in the new version (although I only noticed one minor change in
  my own documents). Furthermore, in order to maintain the higher level of
  structure in the document, the behaviour of the editor in relation to
  multiparagraph environments has slightly changed.

  <tmdoc-title|Computational markup>

  In the menus <menu|Source|Arithmetic>, <menu|Source|Text>,
  <menu|Source|Tuple> and <menu|Source|Condition> you will find different
  primitives for computing with integers, strings, tuples and boolean values.
  For instance, in the following code, the <markup|new-important> tag defines
  a new ``important tag'' as well as a variant in red:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|new-important|<macro|name|<quasi|<style-with|src-compact|none|<style-with|src-compact|none|<assign|<unquote|<arg|name>>|<macro|x|<with|font-series|bold|<arg|x>>>>><style-with|src-compact|none|<assign|<unquote|<merge|<arg|name>|-red>>|<macro|x|<with|font-series|bold|color|red|<arg|x>>>>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Here we use the <markup|merge> primitive in order to concatenate two
  strings. The different computational primitives are described in more
  detail in the <hyper-link|corresponding
  section|../../format/primitives/prim-functional.en.tm> on the
  <hyper-link|<TeXmacs> primitives|../../format/primitives/primitives.en.tm>.

  <tmdoc-title|Evaluation control primitives>

  This section describes several primitives for controlling the way
  expressions in the style-sheet language are evaluated. The primitives are
  analoguous to the <value|scheme> primitives <verbatim|eval>,
  <verbatim|quote>, <verbatim|quasiquote>, <abbr|etc.>, although the
  <TeXmacs> conventions are slightly <hlink|different|../../style/design/style-eval.en.tm>
  than those used by conventional functional languages like <name|Scheme>.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|eval|expr><explain-synopsis|force evaluation>
  <|explain>
    Typeset the result of the evaluation of <src-arg|expr>. This primitive is
    usually combined with a tag like <markup|quote> or <markup|quasiquote>
    for delaying the evaluation.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|quote|expr><explain-synopsis|delayed evaluation>
  <|explain>
    Evaluation of the expression <explain-macro|quote|expr> yields
    <src-arg|expr> itself. This kind of delayed evaluation may be useful in
    combination with the <markup|eval> primitive which forces evaluation.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|quasiquote|expr><explain-synopsis|delay evaluation and
    substitution>
  <|explain>
    This tag is a variant of the <markup|quote> tag, which returns the
    expression <src-arg|expr> in which all subexpressions of the form
    <explain-macro|unquote|subexpr> have been replaced by the evaluations of
    <src-arg|subexpr>. For instance,

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|hello|<quasiquote|<macro|name|<unquote|<localize|Hello>>
      <arg|name>.>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    may be used to define a macro <markup|hello> whose value is localized for
    the current language. In a French document, the declaration would
    typically be equivalent to

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|hello|<macro|name|Bonjour <arg|name>.>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    Notice however that it is usually better not to use the
    <markup|quasiquote> primitive for such applications. When defining

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|hello|<macro|name|<localize|Hello> <arg|name>.>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    the typesetting of <inactive*|<hello|Name>> would naturally adapt itself
    to the current language, while the above version would always use the
    language at the moment of the definition of the macro. Nevertheless, the
    first form does have the advantage that the localization of the word
    ``Hello'' only has to be computed once, when the macro is defined.
    Therefore, the <markup|quasiquote> primitive may sometimes be used in
    order to improve performance.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|unquote|subexpr><explain-synopsis|mark substitutable
    subexpressions>
  <|explain>
    This tag is used in combination with <markup|quasiquote> and
    <markup|quasi> in order to mark the subexpressions which need to be
    evaluated.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|unquote*|subexprs><explain-synopsis|unquote splicing>
  <|explain>
    This tag is similar to <markup|unquote>, except that the argument
    <src-arg|subexprs> now evaluates to a list of subexpressions, which are
    inserted into the arguments of the parent node. For instance, consider
    the macro

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|fun|<xmacro|x|<style-with|src-compact|none|<quasi|<tree|dup|<unquote*|<quote-arg|x>>|<unquote*|<quote-arg|x>>>>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    Then <inactive*|<fun|a|b|c>> is typeset as

    <\equation*>
      <with|fun|<xmacro|x|<quasi|<tree|dup|<unquote*|<quote-arg|x>>|<unquote*|<quote-arg|x>>>>>|<fun|a|b|c>>
    </equation*>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|quasi|expr><explain-synopsis|substitution>
  <|explain>
    This tag is a shortcut for <explain-macro|eval|<with|font-shape|right|<explain-macro|quasiquote|expr>>>.
    This primitive is often used in the <TeXmacs> style files in order to
    write macros which define sets of other macros. For instance, the macro

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|new-theorem|<macro|name|text|<quasi|<assign|<unquote|name>|<macro|body|<surround|<no-indent><strong|<unquote|<arg|text>>.
      >|<right-flush>|<arg|body>>>>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    may be used in order to define new theorem-like environments.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|quote-value|var><explain-synopsis|retrieve a value but
    don't evaluate>
  <|explain>
    When retrieving an environment variable <src-arg|var>, one is usually
    interested in its typesetted value, as given by
    <explain-macro|value|var>. In some cases, it may be useful to access the
    real, non-typesetted value. This can be done with
    <explain-macro|quote-value|var>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|quote-arg|var|index-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|index-n><explain-synopsis|retrieve
    an argument but don't evaluate>
  <|explain>
    When retrieving (a subexpression of) a macro argument <src-arg|var>, one
    is usually interested in its typesetted value, as given by
    <explain-macro|arg|var|index-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|index-n>. In
    some cases, it may be useful to access the real, non-typesetted value.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|General architecture of <TeXmacs>>

  <section|Introduction>

  The <apply|TeXmacs> program has been written in C++. You need
  <verbatim|g++> and the <verbatim|makefile> utility in order to compile
  <apply|TeXmacs>. Currently, the source (in the <verbatim|src> directory) of
  the <apply|TeXmacs> implementation has been divided into the following
  parts:

  <\itemize>
    <item>A set of basic and generic data structures in the <verbatim|Basic>
    directory.

    <item>Standard resources for <apply|TeXmacs>, such as <apply|TeX> fonts,
    languages, encodings and dictionaries, in the <verbatim|Resource>
    directory.

    <item>A documented graphical toolkit in the <verbatim|Window> directory
    (although the documentation is a bit outdated).

    <item>The extension language for <apply|TeXmacs> in the <verbatim|Prg>
    directory.

    <item>The typesetting part of the editor in the directory
    <verbatim|src/Typeset>.

    <item>The editor in the directory <verbatim|src/Edit>.

    <item>The <apply|TeXmacs> server in the directory <verbatim|src/Server>.
  </itemize>

  All parts use the data structures from <verbatim|Basic>. The graphical
  toolkit depends on <verbatim|Resource> for the <apply|TeX> fonts. The
  extension language is independent from <verbatim|Resource> and
  <verbatim|Window>. The typesetting part depends on all other parts except
  from <verbatim|Prg>. The main editor and the <apply|TeXmacs> server use all
  previous parts.

  The <apply|TeXmacs> data are contained in the directory <verbatim|edit>
  which corresponds to the <apply|TeXmacs> distribution without the source
  code. Roughly speaking, we have the following kind of data:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Font data in <verbatim|fonts> (encodings, <verbatim|.pk> files,
    etc.).

    <item>Language data in <verbatim|languages> (hyphenation patterns,
    dictionaries, etc.).

    <item>Document styles in <verbatim|style>.

    <item>Initialization and other <apply|scheme> programs in
    <verbatim|progs>.
  </itemize>

  The directory <verbatim|misc> contains some miscellaneous data like the
  edit icon (<verbatim|misc/pixmaps/traditional/--x17/edit.xpm>).

  <section|Intern representation of texts>

  <apply|TeXmacs> represents all texts by trees (for a fixed text, the
  corresponding tree is called the <em|edit tree>). The nodes of such a tree
  are labeled by standard <em|operators> which are listed in
  <verbatim|Basic/Data/tree.hpp> and <verbatim|Basic/Data/tree.cpp>. The labels
  of the leaves of the tree are strings, which are either invisible (such as
  lengths or macro definitions), or visible (the real text).

  The meaning of the text and the way it is typeset essentially depend on the
  current environment. The environment mainly consists of a relative hash
  table of type <verbatim|rel_hashmap\<less\>string,tree\<gtr\>>, i.e. a
  mapping from the environment variables to their tree values. The current
  language and the current font are examples of system environment variables;
  new variables can be defined by the user.

  <subsection|Text>

  All text strings in <apply|TeXmacs> consist of sequences of either specific
  or universal symbols. A specific symbol is a character, different from
  <verbatim|'\\0'>, <verbatim|'\<less\>'> and <verbatim|'\<gtr\>'>. Its
  meaning may depend on the particular font which is being used. A universal
  symbol is a string starting with <verbatim|'\<less\>'>, followed by an
  arbitrary sequence of characters different from <verbatim|'\\0'>,
  <verbatim|'\<less\>'> and <verbatim|'\<gtr\>'>, and ending with
  <verbatim|'\<gtr\>'>. The meaning of universal characters does not depend
  on the particular font which is used, but different fonts may render them
  in a different way.

  <subsection|The language>

  The language of the text is capable performing a further semantic analysis
  of a text phrase. At least, it is capable of splitting a phrase up into
  <em|words> (which are smaller phrases) and inform the typesetter about the
  desired spaces between words and hyphenation information. In the future,
  additional semantics may be added into languages. For instance, spell
  checkers might be implemented for natural languages and parsers for
  mathematical formulas or programming languages.

  <section|Typesetting texts>

  Roughly speaking, the typesetter of <apply|TeXmacs> takes a tree on input
  and produces a box, while accessing and modifying the typesetting
  environment. The <verbatim|box> class is multifunctional. Its principal
  method is used for displaying the box on a post-script device (either the
  screen or a printer). But it also contains a lot of typesetting
  information, such as logical and ink bounding boxes, the positions of
  scripts, etc.

  Another functionality of boxes is to convert between physical cursors
  (positions on the screen) and logical cursors (paths in the edit tree).
  Actually, boxes are also organized into a tree, which often simplifies the
  conversion. However, because of macro expansions and line and page
  breaking, the conversion routines may become quite intricate. Notice also
  that, besides a horizontal and vertical position, the physical cursor also
  contains an infinitesimal horizontal position. Roughly speaking, this
  infinitesimal coordinate is used to give certain boxes (such as color
  changes) an extra infinitesimal width.

  <section|Making modifications in texts>

  In <verbatim|Edit/Modify> you find different routines for modifying the
  edit tree. Modifications go in several steps:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>A certain input event triggers an action, such as
    <verbatim|make_fraction>, which intends to modify the edit tree.

    <item>All modifications which <verbatim|make_fraction> or its subroutines
    will make to the edit tree eventually break down to seven elementary
    modification routines, namely <verbatim|assign>, <verbatim|insert>,
    <verbatim|remove>, <verbatim|split>, <verbatim|join>,
    <verbatim|ins_unary> and <verbatim|rem_unary>.

    <item>Before performing the required modification, the elementary
    modification routine first notifies all views of the same text of the
    modification.

    <item>On notification, each view updates several things, such as the
    cursor position. It also notifies the modification to the typesetter of
    the text, since the typesetter maintains a list of already typeset
    paragraphs.

    <item>When all views have been notified of the modification, we really
    perform it.

    <item>Each user action like a keystroke or a mouse click is responsible
    for inserting <em|undo points> between sequences of elementary
    modifications. When undoing a modification, the editor will move to the
    previous undo point.
  </enumerate>

  <tmdoc-title|The style-sheet language>

  In the section about <hlink|writing a simple style
  package|style-example.en.tm> we already gave you a first impression about
  the style-sheet language of <TeXmacs>. In this section, we will give a more
  complete survey of the available features. For more detailed descriptions,
  we refer to the chapter about the <hlink|<TeXmacs>
  primitives|../../format/primitives/primitives.en.tm>.

  The style-sheet primitives can be obtained from the <menu|Source> menu when
  you are in source mode. In all other modes, the <menu|Source> menu becomes
  visible after enabling the <menu|Source macros tool> in the <menu|Tools>
  menu. Alternatively, you may use the <prefix|A-> and <prefix|executable>
  keyboard prefixes in source mode and the<nbsp><prefix|inactive>
  and<nbsp><prefix|executable> prefixes otherwise. Furthermore, we recall
  that the hybrid <key|\\>-key may be used for creating macro-applications or
  arguments, depending on the context. Finally, the
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)> and <shortcut|(structured-insert-left)>
  keys are used for inserting arguments.

  The <tmdtd|program> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides markup for the layout of

  unstable, since we plan to replace them by a set of more detailed tags:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|algorithm|name|body>>
    The <src-arg|name> of the algorithm and its <src-arg|body>, which
    includes its possible specification.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|body|body>>
    The real body of the algorithm.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|indent|content>>
    For indenting part of an algorithm.

  <tmdoc-title|Macros and environment variables>

  The main key-combinations that you should know to write style files are the
  following:

  <\description>
    <item*|<key|inactive =>>creates a new assignment. The first argument is a new
    command name and the second argument an expression.

    <item*|<key|inactive w>>permits to locally change one or more environment
    variables. With statements are of the form
    <with|mode|math|\<langle\>x<rsub|1>\|a<rsub|1>\|\<cdots\>\|x<rsub|n>\|a<rsub|n>\|b\<rangle\>>,
    where the <with|mode|math|x<rsub|i>> are the names of the variables, the
    <with|mode|math|a<rsub|i>> their local values, and <with|mode|math|b> the
    text on which the local environment applies.

    <item*|<key|inactive m>>creates a macro. Arguments to the macro can be inserted
    using the <key|tab>-key.

    <item*|<key|inactive #>>get the value of a macro argument.

    <item*|<key|inactive v>>get the value of an environment variable.

    <item*|<key|inactive e>>expands the macro with zero or more arguments.
  </description>

  More precisely, when evaluating a macro expansion
  <with|mode|math|{a\|x<rsub|1>\|\<cdots\>\|x<rsub|n>}> created by
  <key|inactive e>, the following action is undertaken:

  <\itemize>
    <item>If <with|mode|math|a> is not a string nor a macro, then
    <with|mode|math|a> is evaluated once. This results either in a macro name
    or a macro expression <with|mode|math|f>.

    <item>If we obtain a macro name, then we replace <with|mode|math|f> by
    the value of the environment variable <with|mode|math|f>. If, after this,
    <with|mode|math|f> is still not a macro expression, then we return
    <with|mode|math|f>.

    <item>Let <with|mode|math|y<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,y<rsub|n>> be the arguments
    of <with|mode|math|f> and <with|mode|math|b> it's body (superfluous
    arguments are discarded; missing arguments take the empty string as their
    default value). Then we substitute <with|mode|math|x<rsub|i>> for each
    <with|mode|math|y<rsub|i>> in <with|mode|math|b> and return the evaluated
    result.

  <tmdoc-title|Writing <TeXmacs> style files>

  One of the fundamental strengths of <TeXmacs> is the possibility to write
  your own style files and packages. The purpose of style files is multiple:

  <\itemize>
    <item>They allow the abstraction of repetitive elements in texts, like
    sections, theorems, enumerations, etc.

    <item>They form a mechanism which allow you to structure your text. For
    instance, you may indicate that a given portion of your text is an
    abbreviation, a quotation or ``important''.

    <item>Standard document styles enable you to write professionally looking
    documents, because the corresponding style files have been written with a
    lot of care by people who know a lot about typography and aesthetics.
  </itemize>

  The user may select a major style from the <menu|Document|Style> menu. The
  major style usually reflects the kind of document you want to produce (like
  a letter, an article or a book) or a particular layout policy (like
  publishing an article in a given journal).

  Style packages, which are selected from the <menu|Document|Style> menu, are
  used for further customization of the major style. For instance, the
  <tmpackage|number-europe> package enables European-style theorem numbering
  and the <tmpackage|maxima> package contains macros for customizing the
  layout of sessions of the <name|Maxima> computer algebra system. Several
  packages may be used together.

  When you want to add your own markup to <TeXmacs> or personalize the
  layout, then you have to choose between writing a principal style file or a
  style package. In most cases, you will probably prefer to write a style
  package, since this will allow you to combine it arbitrary other styles.
  However, in some cases you may prefer to create a new principal style,
  usually by personalizing an existing style. This is usually the case if you
  want to mimic the layout policy of some journal. In this chapter, we will
  both explain how to write your own style packages and how to customize the
  standard styles.

  <tmdoc-title|The <TeXmacs> database model>

  The <TeXmacs> database manipulation API has mainly been designed for
  internal use. It is based on a<nbsp>dedicated
  <hlink|NoSQL|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL>-style database model,
  using a variant of <hlink|column data stores|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_%28data_store%29>.
  For the moment, we only support a limit number of entry types and field
  types, although new types can easily be added later. Currently, databases
  are used for managing remote files, bibliographies, user lists, versions,
  etc.

  The interface has been kept to be as simple as possible, so that our low
  level implementation can be most easily optimized for efficiently when
  needed. Furthermore, the routines of our basic API can all be customized
  <em|a posteriori> to add specific features. For instance, the basic API is
  string-based, so a<nbsp>special additional layer was added to support
  <TeXmacs> snippets as values instead of strings. Similarly, an additional
  layer was added for managing the permissions of specific users. The
  advantage of this design based on <em|a posteriori> customizations is that
  the routines in the basic API always keep the same semantics, no matter how
  many additional layers are added.

  A <TeXmacs> database is always a collection of database <em|entries>. Each
  entry consists of a <em|unique identifier> and a list of <em|fields>. Each
  field consists of an <em|attribute>, a list of <em|values>, a <em|creation
  date> and an <em|expiration date>. The creation and expirationd dates
  cannot be manipulated directly, but it is possible to specify an
  alternative time for database queries, which make it possible to easily
  recover any past state of the database.

  <paragraph|Macros for context specification>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(with-database db . body)><explain-synopsis|specify a database>
  <|explain>
    Execute <scm|body> with <scm|db> as the current database. Here <scm|db>
    should be an URL with extension <verbatim|.tmdb>. The database <scm|db>
    will be used by all routines of the database API called from within
    <scm|body>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(with-time t . body)><explain-synopsis|specify a time>
  <|explain>
    Execute <scm|body> with <scm|t> as the current time. All database queries
    inside <scm|body> become relative to the time<nbsp><scm|t>, which allows
    for the inspection of past states of the database. The parameter <scm|t>
    is an integer representing a UNIX time stamp, or <scm|:now>. Any
    modifications of the database require <scm|:now> to be specified as the
    current time.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(with-time-stamp on? . body)><explain-synopsis|add date field to new
    entries>
  <|explain>
    Whenever <scm|on?> holds, a <scm|date> attribute will automatically be
    added to all newly created entries which do not already contain a
    <scm|date> field. For entries which circulate among several users, this
    allows you to determine when they were created for the first time.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(with-extra-fields l . body)><explain-synopsis|add fields to
    entries>
  <|explain>
    Whenever a new entry with fields <scm|new-l> is created inside
    <scm|body>, the list of fields <scm|l> is automatically added to
    <scm|new-l>, but only for attributes which were not already present in
    <scm|new-l>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(with-limit limit . body)><explain-synopsis|limit number of return
    values>
  <|explain>
    For queries of the database inside <scm|body>, limit the number of
    returned values to <scm|limit>.
  </explain>

  <paragraph|Special attributes>

  <\description>
    <item*|<scm|name>>A name (or key) for the entry, by which it can referred
    to.

    <item*|<scm|date>>Creation date stamp for the entry, as determined by
    <scm|with-time-stamp>.
  </description>

  <paragraph|Main routines of the database API>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-set-field id attr vals)><explain-synopsis|set values for a given
    field>
  <|explain>
    For the field with atrribute <scm|attr> in the entry with identifier
    <scm|id>, set the values to <scm|vals>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-get-field id attr)><explain-synopsis|get all values for a given
    field>
  <|explain>
    Get the list of values for the field with atrribute <scm|attr> in the
    entry with identifier <scm|id>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-get-attributes id)><explain-synopsis|get the list of attributes>
  <|explain>
    Get the list of attributes for the entry with identifier <scm|id>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-set-entry id l)><explain-synopsis|fill out a complete entry>
  <|explain>
    For the entry with identifier <scm|id>, set the list of fields to
    <scm|l>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-get-entry id)><explain-synopsis|retrieve a complete entry>
  <|explain>
    Get the list of fields for the entry with identifier <scm|id>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-remove-entry id)><explain-synopsis|remove a complete entry>
  <|explain>
    Remove the entry with identifier <scm|id>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-create-id)><explain-synopsis|create a unique identifier>
  <|explain>
    Create an identifier which does not yet exist in the database.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-search q)><explain-synopsis|search for a list of fields>
  <|explain>
    Return the list of identifiers of entries which match a given query
    <scm|q>. The query <scm|q> is a list of constraints of the form
    <scm|(attr val1 ... valn)>. Each constraint is interpreted as ``the
    attribute <scm|attr> of the entry is one of the values <scm|val1>,
    <math|\<ldots\>>, <scm|valn>''. In addition to these <em|basic>
    constraints, extensions of the database API may implement additional
    kinds of constraints. Such <em|supplementary> constraints are always
    formed by taking a special keyword for <scm|attr>.

    The basic API already implements one type of supplementary constraint of
    the form <scm|(:order attr asc?)>, where <scm|attr> is an attribute and
    <scm|asc?> a boolean value. This kind of supplementary constraint is
    always satisfied and has the effect of ordering the output of the query
    on the attribute <scm|attr> in ascending or descending order, depending
    on <scm|asc?>.
  </explain>

  <paragraph|Other useful routines>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-get-field-first id attr)><explain-synopsis|get first value for a
    given field>
  <|explain>
    Get the first value in <scm|(db-get-field id attr)> or <scm|#f>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-create-entry l)><explain-synopsis|create a new entry>
  <|explain>
    Create a new entry in the current database with fields <scm|l>, and
    return the identifier of the newly created entry.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-entry-exists? id)><explain-synopsis|test existence of entry>
  <|explain>
    Test whether there exists an entry with identifier <scm|id>.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(view-\<gtr\>window <scm-arg|vw>)><explain-synopsis|window to which

    <scm|(view-passive <scm-arg|buf>)>

    <scm|(view-recent <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|get view on buffer>
  <|explain>
    All three routines return a view on the buffer <scm-arg|buf>. In the case
    of <scm|view-new>, we systematically create a new view. The routine
    <scm|view-passive> first attempts to find an existing view on
    <scm-arg|buf> which is not attached to a window; if no such view exists,
    then a new one is created. The last routine <scm|view-recent> returns the
    most recent existing view, with a preference for the current view, or
    another visible view. Again, a new view is created if no suitable recent
    view exists.

  <tmdoc-title|Generalities for typing text>

  The usual English characters and punctuation symbols can easily be obtained
  on most keyboards. Most modern system also implement standard shortcuts in
  order to obtain accented characters and other special symbols. If
  necessary, accented characters can also be obtained using the
  <prefix|accent> prefix. For instance, ``'' is obtained by typing
  <key|accent:acute e>. Similarly, we obtain ``'' via <key|accent:grave a>
  and so on.

  Long words at borders of successive lines are automatically hyphenated. In
  order to hyphenate foreign languages correctly, you should specify the
  language of the document in the menu <menu|Document|Language>.

  At the left hand side of the footer, you see the document style, the text
  properties at the current cursor position. Initially, it displays ``generic
  text roman 10'', which means that you type in text mode using a 10 point
  roman font and the generic document style. You can change the text
  properties (font, font size, color, language) in the <menu|Format> menu.
  You can also change the text properties of the text you have already typed
  by selecting a region and then using the <menu|Format> menu. Some text
  properties can also be changed for all the document with the
  <menu|Document> menu.

  At the right hand side of the footer, the character or object (like a
  change in the text properties) just before the cursor is displayed. We also
  display all environments which are active at the cursor position. This
  information should help you to orient yourself in the document.

  <tmdoc-title|ASCII-based or tree-based editing: an intricate choice>

  Most users are used to edit source code using a conventional editor like
  <name|Emacs>, while presenting the source code in ASCII format. Since all
  <TeXmacs> documents are stored as <hyper-link|trees|../../format/format.en.tm>,
  an interesting but complicated question is which format is most suitable
  for editing such documents. One option is to represent the tree using an
  ASCII-based format, such as XML, Scheme, or the native format for storing
  files on a disk. The other option is to edit the trees as such, making no
  fundamental distinction between source code and normal documents.

  In <TeXmacs> we have chosen to implement the second option. More precisely,
  any document can be edited in ``source mode'', which is merely a mode for
  rendering the document in a way which makes its tree structure particularly
  apparent. It may be instructive to take an arbitrary document of yours and
  to take a look at it in ``source mode'' by enabling
  <menu|Document|Source|Edit source tree>.

  The choice between ASCII-based editing and tree-based editing is
  non-trivial, because <TeXmacs> style files and packages have a double
  nature: they may be seen as programs which specify how to render macros,
  but these programs naturally contain ordinary content. There are several
  reasons why users often prefer to edit source code in an ASCII-based
  format:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>It is easy to manually format the code so as to make it more
    readable.

    <item>In particular, it is easy to add comments.

    <item>Standard editors like <name|Emacs> provide tools for automatic
    highlighting, indentation, <abbr|etc.>

    <item><label|structure-constraints>One is not constraint by any
    ``structure'' during the editing phase.
  </enumerate>

  Our approach is to reproduce as much of the above advantages in a
  structured document environment. Although point
  <reference|structure-constraints> will obviously be hard to meet when
  following this approach, we believe that the first three advantages might
  actually become greater in a structured environment. However, this requires
  a more profound understanding of how users format and edit source code.

  For instance, consider a piece of manually formatted code like

  <\cpp-fragment>
    if (cond) hop \ \ = 2;

    else \ \ \ \ \ holala= 3;
  </cpp-fragment>

  Clearly, the user had a particular formatting policy when writing this
  code. However, this policy does not appear in the document: manual
  intervention will be necessary if the variable <verbatim|cond> is renamed
  <verbatim|c>, or if the variable <verbatim|holala> is renamed
  <verbatim|hola>.

  At the moment, <TeXmacs> provides no tools for dealing with the above
  example in an automatic way, but a few tools are already provided. For
  instance, the user is given a great amount of control on how to indent
  source code and reasonable defaults are provided as a function of the
  structure. We also provide high level environments for comments and
  structured highlighting. Further tools will be developed later and we are
  open for any suggestions from our users.

    Similar to <markup|render-enunciation>, but for exercise-like
    environments.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-proof|name|body>>
    Similar to <markup|render-enunciation>, but for proofs. This environment
    is mainly used for customizing the name of a proof, like in ``End of the
    proof of theorem 1.2''.
  </explain>

  Notice that you may also use these macros if you want an environment which
  is rendered in a similar way as a theorem, but with another name (like
  ``Corollary of Theorem 7'').

  The following tags can be used for further customization of the rendering:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enunciation-name|name>>
    This macro controls the appearance of the names of theorem-like,
    remark-like <em|and> exercise-like environments. Most styles use bold
    face or small capitals.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|theorem-name|name>

    <explain-macro|remark-name|name>

    <explain-macro|exercise-name|name>
  <|explain>
    These macros default to <markup|enunciation-name>, but can be customized
    individually.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enunciation-sep>>
    The separator between the name of a theorem-like, remark-like or
    exercise-like environment and its main body. By default, this is a period
    followed by a space.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|theorem-sep>

    <explain-macro|remark-sep>

    <explain-macro|exercise-sep>
  <|explain>
    These macros default to <markup|enunciation-sep>, but can be customized
    individually.
  </explain>

  Each standard environment <markup|<em|x>> also comes with a customizable
  macro <markup|<em|x>-text> which renders the localized name of the
  environment. For instance, <inactive*|<with|language|dutch|<theorem-text>>>
  yields ``<with|language|dutch|<theorem-text>>''.

  <tmdoc-title|Installing and using a plug-in>

  From the user's point of view, a plug-in <verbatim|<em|myplugin>> will
  usually be distributed on some web-site as a binary tarball with the name

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <em|myplugin>-<em|version>-<em|architecture>.tar.gz
  </verbatim>

  If you installed <TeXmacs> yourself in the directory
  <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH>, then you should unpack this tarball in the
  directory <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/plugins>, using

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ tar -zxvf <em|myplugin>-<em|version>-<em|architecture>.tar.gz
  </verbatim>

  This will create a <verbatim|<em|myplugin>> subdirectory in
  <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/plugins>. As soon as you restart <TeXmacs>, the
  plug-in should be automatically recognized. Please read the documentation
  which comes with your plug-in in order to learn using it.

  <\remark>
    If you did not install <TeXmacs> yourself, or if you do not have write
    access to <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH>, then you may also unpack the tarball
    in <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins>. Here we recall that
    <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH> defaults to <verbatim|$HOME/.TeXmacs>. When
    starting <TeXmacs>, your plug-in should again be automatically
    recognized.
  </remark>

  <\remark>
    If the plug-in is distributed as a source tarball like
    <verbatim|<em|myplugin>-<em|version>-src.tar.gz>, then you should first
    compile the source code before relaunching <TeXmacs>. Depending on the
    plug-in (read the instructions), this is usually done using

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ cd <em|myplugin>; make
    </verbatim>

    or

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ cd <em|myplugin>; ./configure; make
    </verbatim>
  </remark>

  <\remark>
    In order to upgrade a plug-in, just remove the old version in
    <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/plugins> or <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins>
    using

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ rm -rf <em|myplugin>
    </verbatim>

    and reinstall as explained above.

  <tmdoc-title|Bibliographies>

  The following macros may be used in the main text for citations to entries
  in a bibliographic database.

  <\explain|<explain-macro|cite|ref-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|ref-n>>
    Each argument <src-arg|ref-i> is a citation corresponding to an item in a
    BiB-<TeX> file. The citations are displayed in the same way as they are
    referenced in the bibliography and they also provide hyperlinks to the
    corresponding references. The citations are displayed as question marks
    if you did not generate the bibliography. Once you've added a
    bibliography file, pressing <key|tab> inside the arguments will
    auto-complete with the cite-keys in your file.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|nocite|ref-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|ref-n>>
    Similar as <markup|cite>, but the citations are not displayed in the main
    text.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|cite-detail|ref|info>>
    A bibliographic reference <src-arg|ref> like <markup|cite> and
    <markup|nocite>, but with some additional information <src-arg|info>,
    like a chapter or a page number.
  </explain>

  The following macros may be redefined if you want to customize the
  rendering of citations or entries in the generated bibliography:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-cite|ref>>
    Macro for rendering a citation <src-arg|ref> at the place where the
    citation is made using <markup|cite>. The <src-arg|content> may be a
    single reference, like ``TM98'', or a list of references, like ``Euler1,
    Gauss2''.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-cite-detail|ref|info>>
    Similar to <markup|render-cite>, but for detailed citations made with
    <markup|cite-detail>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|render-bibitem|content>

    <explain-macro|transform-bibitem|content>
  <|explain>
    At the moment, bibliographies are generated by Bib<TeX> and imported into
    <TeXmacs>. The produced bibliography is a list of bibliographic items
    with are based on special <LaTeX>-specific macros (<markup|bibitem>,
    <markup|block>, <markup|protect>, <abbr|etc.>). These macros are all
    defined internally in <TeXmacs> and eventually boil down to calls of the
    <markup|render-bibitem>, which behaves in a similar way as
    <markup|item*>, and which may be redefined by the user.

    The <markup|transform-bibitem> is used to ``decorate'' the
    <src-arg|content>. For instance, <markup|transform-bibitem> may put
    angular brackets and a space around <src-arg|content>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|bib-list|largest|body>>
    The individual ``bibitems'' are enclosed in a <markup|bib-list>, which
    behaves in a similar way as the <markup|description> environment, except
    that we provide an extra parameter <src-arg|largest> which contains a
    good indication about the largest width of an item in the list.

  <tmdoc-title|Line breaking primitives>

  A simple document is a sequence of <def-index|logical paragraphs>, one for
  each subtree of a <markup|document> or <markup|paragraph> node. Paragraphs
  whose width exceed the available horizontal space are broken into
  <em|physical lines> by the hyphenation algorithm. By default, hyphenated
  lines are justified: horizontal spaces can be shrunk or extended in order
  to produce a good-looking layout.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|new-line><explain-synopsis|start a new paragraph>
  <|explain>
    This is a deprecated tag in order to split a logical paragraph into
    several logical paragraphs without creating explicit subtrees for all
    paragraphs.

    We recall that logical paragraphs are important structures for the
    typesetting process. Many primitives and environment variables (vertical
    spacing, paragraph style, indentation, page breaking, etc.) operate on
    whole paragraphs or at the boundaries of the enclosing paragraph.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|next-line><explain-synopsis|start a new line>
  <|explain>
    This is a tag which will become deprecated as soon as the
    <markup|paragraph> primitive will be correctly implemented. Its usage is
    similar to the <markup|new-line> tag with the difference that we start a
    new logical paragraph unit instead of a new logical paragraph.

    Currently, the <markup|next-line> tag can also be used in order to force
    a line break with the additional property that the line before the break
    is not justified or filled.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|line-break><explain-synopsis|line breaking hint, with
    filling>
  <|explain>
    Print an invisible space with zero hyphenation penalty. The line breaking
    algorithm searches for the set of hyphenation points minimizing the total
    penalty, so line breaking is much more likely to occur at a
    <markup|line-break> than anywhere else in its vicinity.

    Unlike <markup|next-line>, this is a hint which may or may not be obeyed
    by the typesetter, and it does not prevent the previous line from being
    filled.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|no-break><explain-synopsis|forbid line breaking at this
    point>
  <|explain>
    Set an hyphenation point with an infinite penalty. That is useful when
    the hyphenation patterns for a language fall short of preventing some
    forbidden patterns like ``arse-nal'' or ``con-genital''. An alternative
    way to prevent breaks is to use the <markup|rigid> tag.

  <tmdoc-title|Using GNU <TeXmacs> as an interface>

  An important feature of <TeXmacs> is it's ability to communicate with
  extern systems. For computer algebra systems or other scientific
  computation systems, this is typically done in shell-like sessions, in
  which it is possible to evaluate commands and display the results in a
  nice, graphical way. Some systems can also be used more in the background
  as scripting languages.

  See <menu|Help|Plug-ins> for a list of existing plug-ins and more
  documentation on these systems.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Converters to other data formats>

  Currently, we have implemented imperfect converters between <apply|TeXmacs>
  and <apply|LaTeX> and from html to <apply|TeXmacs>. We hope that someone
  else will be willing to write better converters from scratch. This chapter
  has been included in order to give some recommendations in that direction
  based on our experience from the implementation of the actual conversion
  programs. We also recommend to take a look at the current implementations
  in the directory <verbatim|Convert>.

  <section|Parsing extern data formats>

  In order to write a converter from <apply|LaTeX> html, xml, etc. to
  <apply|TeXmacs>, a good first step is to write a parser for the extern data
  format. For html, xml, etc. this should be rather easy, but for
  <apply|LaTeX>, you will probably need to be a real <apply|LaTeX> guru
  (which I am not). We recommend the result of the parsing step to be a
  <apply|scheme> expression (something which is regrettable not the case for
  our actual converters), because this language is very well adapted for the
  implementation of the actual converter.

  This first step should be able to process any correct file having the
  extern data format; possible incompatibilities should only come into play
  during the actual conversion. In the case of <apply|LaTeX>, one should not
  expand the macros and keep all macro definitions, because <apply|TeXmacs>
  will be able to take advantage out of this.

  <section|The actual converter>

  We recommend the actual converter to proceed in several steps. Often it is
  convenient to start with a rough, structural, conversion step, which is
  ``polished'' by a certain number of additional steps. These additional
  steps may take care of some very particular layout issues which can not be
  treated conveniently at the main step.

  Actually, the main difficulties usually come from exceptional text, like
  verbatim, and layout issues which are handled differently in the extern
  data format and <apply|TeXmacs>. A good example of such a difference
  between <apply|LaTeX> and <apply|TeXmacs> is the way equations or lists are
  handled. Consider for instance the following paragraph:

  Text before.

  <\expand|equation*>
    a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>.
  </expand>

  Text after.

  In <apply|LaTeX>, the equation is really seen as a part of the paragraph.
  Indeed, there will not be any blank line between ``Text before'' and the
  equation. However, for efficiency reasons, it is better to see the
  paragraph as three paragraphs in <apply|TeXmacs>, because the lines can be
  typesetted independently. Nevertheless, the equation environment will
  disable the indentation of ``Text after''.

  As a result of this anomaly, converted texts have to be postprocessed, so
  as to insert paragraph breaks at strategic places. It should be noticed
  that this step may be independent from the format which is actually being
  converted and that a similar reverse step may be implemented for backward
  conversions. We also notice that one needs an exhaustive list of all
  similar exceptional environments for this postprocessing step. Actually, a
  future version of <apply|TeXmacs> might come with an additional feature,
  which permits the automatic detection of such environments. This is also
  important from a semantical point of view, because one should be able to
  detect that the above example logically forms only one and not three
  paragraphs.

  <section|Backward conversions>

  Conversions from <apply|TeXmacs> to an extern data format are usually
  easier to implement, because the <apply|TeXmacs> data format is
  semantically rich. However, conversions to an extern data format without a
  <apply|TeX>-like macro facility give rise to the problem of macro expansion
  of non supported <apply|TeXmacs> functions or environments. We plan to
  write a facility for this, which you will be able to use when writing a
  converter from <apply|TeXmacs> to something else.

  <tmdoc-title|Animations>

  <TeXmacs> provides some rudimentary support for animations inside laptop
  presentations. This support is likely to be further improved in future
  <TeXmacs> distributions.

  The simplest animations are available from the menus
  <menu|Insert|Animation|Translate> and <menu|Insert|Animation|Progressive>.
  Using the first menu, it is possible to create moving content: you first
  specify a duration for the full animation and then enter the content which
  has to be moved. The different kinds of moving content are illustrated in
  figure<nbsp><reference|translate-fig>. Similarly, using the second menu, it
  is possible to create content which only progressively appears on the
  screen. The various kinds of progressive content are illustrated in
  figure<nbsp><reference|progressive-fig>. The duration of the animations can
  be <hlink|modified <em|a<nbsp>posteriori>|../editing/man-structured-geometry.en.tm>
  by putting your cursor inside them and using the shortcuts
  <shortcut|(geometry-left)> and<nbsp><shortcut|(geometry-right)>.

  Other basic animations are ``animated gif pictures'', which can be inserted
  from <menu|Insert|Animation|Animation>, and sounds, which can be inserted
  from <menu|Insert|Animation|Sound>. Support for movies should be added
  later.

  It is also possible to combine animation, so as to form larger animations.
  For instance, using <menu|Insert|Animation|Compose> you can play several
  animations one after another. Often the individual elements of a composed
  animations are fixed animation of a given duration, which can be inserted
  using <menu|Insert|Animation|Fixed>. Of course, you may also use moving or
  progressive content or even composed animations as building blocks. An
  animation can be repeated indefinitely using
  <menu|Insert|Animation|Repeat>. This may for instance be used to create a
  blinking effect. Some examples of the various possibilities can be found in

  <tmdoc-title|Multiple extractions>

  <TeXmacs> allows users to create multiple bibliographies, tables of
  contents, indexes, <abbr|etc.> inside the same document. Let us explain how
  to do this for bibliographies; the procedure is similar for other types of
  automatically generated content.

  First of all, every separate bibliography is identified by a ``name''. The
  default name of the bibliography is <verbatim|bib>. Using
  <menu|Insert|Link|Alternate|Bibliography>, it is possible to specify a
  different bibliography (than the default one) for a certain region of text.

  For instance, to specify that a given citation should appear in a second
  bibliography with name <verbatim|bib2>, you should proceed as follows:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Click on <menu|Insert|Link|Alternate|Bibliography> and enter
    <verbatim|bib2> on the prompt. This will insert an empty
    <markup|with-bib> tag into your document, with the cursor inside.

    <item>Inside this <markup|with-bib> tag, enter your citation, using
    <menu|Insert|Link|Citation>.
  </itemize>

  If needed, the <markup|with-bib> tag can be made to span over a large
  portion of text. All citations inside this span will be be put into the
  bibliography with name <verbatim|bib2>.

  The bibliography <verbatim|bib2> itself should be created in a similar way:
  first click on <menu|Insert|Link|Alternate|Bibliography> and enter
  <verbatim|bib2> on the prompt. Next insert the bibliography as usual,
  <em|via> <menu|Insert|Automatic|Bibliography>. Now do
  <menu|Document|Update|All> as many times as need in order to generate the
  bibliography and get all links right.

  <tmdoc-title|Example of a plug-in with <name|C++> code>

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|minimal> plug-in>

  Consider the example of the <verbatim|minimal> plug-in in the directory

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/examples/plugins
  </verbatim>

  It consists of the following files:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|minimal/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|minimal/progs/init-minimal.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|minimal/src/minimal.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  In order to try the plug-in, you first have to recursively copy the
  directory

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/examples/plugins/minimal
  </verbatim>

  to <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs> or <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/progs>.
  Next, running the <verbatim|Makefile> using

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ make
  </verbatim>

  will compile the program <verbatim|minimal.cpp> and create a binary

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ minimal/bin/minimal.bin
  </verbatim>

  When relaunching <TeXmacs>, the plug-in should now be automatically
  recognized.

  <paragraph*|How it works>

  The <verbatim|minimal> plug-in demonstrates a minimal interface between
  <TeXmacs> and an extern program; the program <verbatim|minimal.cpp> is
  <hyper-link|explained|../interface/interface-pipes.en.tm> in more detail in
  the chapter about writing interfaces. The initialization file
  <verbatim|init-minimal.scm> essentially contains the following code:

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (plugin-configure minimal

    \ \ (:require (url-exists-in-path? "minimal.bin"))

    \ \ (:launch "minimal.bin")

    \ \ (:session "Minimal"))
  </scheme-fragment>

  The <scheme-code|:require> option checks whether <verbatim|minimal.bin>
  indeed exists in the path (so this will fail if you forgot to run the
  <verbatim|Makefile>). The <scheme-code|:launch> option specifies how to
  launch the extern program. The <verbatim|:session> option indicates that it
  will be possible to create sessions for the <verbatim|minimal> plug-in
  using <menu|Insert|Session|Minimal>.

  <tmdoc-title|Ongoing external developments>

  Some people which are not part of the core development team use <TeXmacs>
  for other projects. We do our best to support such external developments
  and make the necessary changes inside <TeXmacs> when necessary. Here
  follows a list of a few initiatives that we are aware of:

  <\itemize>
    <item><hlink|Lionel Mamane|http://www.cs.ru.nl/~lionelm/> is developing a
    plug-in for the <hlink|<name|Coq>|http://coq.inria.fr/coq-fra.html> proof
    assistant, called <name|Tmegg>. A first version of this plug-in is about
    to be released; please check Lionel's homepage. Similarly, Henri Lesourd
    is developing an interface to the <hlink|Omega
    system|http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~omega/software/omega/index.html>. The
    use of <TeXmacs> as a front-end for proof assistants and theorem provers
    raises interesting questions about asynchroneous plug-in evaluations,
    keeping track and appropriate rendering of the state of a prover,
    appropriate mathematical and proof markup, etc.

    <item>Saugata Basu, Richard Pollack and Marie-Franois Roy have written
    an interactive book ``<hlink|Algorithms in Real Algebraic
    Geometry|http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/marie-francoise.roy/bpr-posted1.html>''
    using <TeXmacs>. Any people interested in developing addional interactive
    features inside <TeXmacs> are invited to contact us.

    <item><hlink|Felix Breuer|http://www.felixbreuer.net/index.html> and
    formerly <name|David Mentr> have considered developing a <hlink|literate
    programming plug-in|http://david.mentre.free.fr/serendipity/index.php?/archives/8-Literate-programming-as-source-code-comments.html>
    for <TeXmacs>. Another such initiative is
    <hlink|<name|Fangle>|http://www.nongnu.org/fangle/>, which has recently
    been started by <name|Sam Liddicott>. Any concrete implementation of
    their proposals would happily find its way into the main distribution.
  </itemize>

  If you want to start a project based on <TeXmacs>, then please let us know.

  <tmdoc-title|Customizing numbered textual environments>

  <TeXmacs> provides three standard types of numbered textual environments:
  theorem-like environments, remark-like environments and exercise-like
  environments. The following aspects of these environments can be easily
  customized:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Adding new environments.

    <item>Modifying the rendering of the environments.

    <item>Numbering the theorems in a different way.
  </itemize>

  <paragraph*|Defining new environments>

  First of all, new environments can be added using the meta-macros
  <markup|new-theorem>, <markup|new-remark> and <markup|new-exercise>. These
  environments take two arguments: the name of the environment and the name
  which is used for its rendering. For instance, you may wish to define the
  environment <markup|experiment> by

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<new-theorem|experiment|Experiment>>
  </tm-fragment>

  When available in the <TeXmacs> dictionaries, the text ``Experiment'' will
  be automatically translated when your document is written in a foreign
  language. In the section about <hyper-link|how to define new
  environments|../../../main/styles/std-dtds/env-manage-dtd.en.tm>, it is
  also explained how to define other numbered textual environments (besides
  theorems, remarks and exercises).

  <paragraph*|Customization of the rendering>

  The principal rendering of the environments can be customized by redefining
  the <markup|render-theorem>, <markup|render-remark> and
  <markup|render-exercise> macros. These macros take the <src-arg|name> of
  the environment (like ``Theorem <no-break>1.2'') and its <src-arg|body> as
  arguments. For instance, if you want theorems to appear in a slightly
  indented way, with a slanted body, then you may redefine
  <markup|render-theorem> as follows:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|render-theorem|<\macro|which|body>
      <padded-normal|1fn|1fn|<surround|<theorem-name|<arg|which><theorem-sep>>||<with|font-shape|slanted|par-left|<plus|<value|par-left>|1.5fn>|<arg|body>>>>
    </macro>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  This redefinition produces the following effect:

  <\with|render-theorem|<\macro|which|body>
    <padded-normal|1fn|1fn|<surround|<theorem-name|<arg|which><theorem-sep>>||<with|font-shape|slanted|par-left|<plus|<value|par-left>|1.5fn>|<arg|body>>>>
  </macro>>
    <\theorem>
      This is a theorem which has been typeset in a slanted font.
    </theorem>
  </with>

  By default, the theorems are rendered as remarks with the only difference
  that their bodies are typeset in an italic font. Hence, redefining the
  <markup|render-remark> macro will also affect the rendering of theorems.
  The default <markup|render-proof> macro is also based on
  <markup|render-remark>.

  Instead of redefining the entire rendering, the user might just wish to
  customize the way names of theorems are rendered or redefine the separator
  between the name and the body. As the user may have noticed by examining
  the above redefinition of <markup|render-theorem>, these aspects are
  controlled by the macros <markup|theorem-name> and <markup|theorem-sep>.
  For instance, consider the following redefinitions:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|theorem-name|<macro|name|<with|color|dark
    red|font-series|bold|<arg|name>>>>>

    <inactive*|<assign|theorem-sep|<macro|: >>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Then theorem-like environments will be rendered as follows:

  <\with|theorem-name|<macro|name|<with|color|dark
  red|font-series|bold|<arg|name>>>|theorem-sep|<macro|: >>
    <\proposition>
      This proposition is rendered in is a fancy way.
    </proposition>
  </with>

  <paragraph*|Customization of the numbering>

  In the sections about <hyper-link|counters and counter
  groups|../../../main/styles/std/std-counter-dtd.en.tm>, it is explained how
  to customize the counters of numbered environments for particular purposes.
  For instance, by redefining <markup|inc-theorem>, you may force theorems to
  reset the counter of corollaries:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<style-with|src-compact|none|<quasi|<style-with|src-compact|none|<assign|inc-theorem|<macro|<compound|<unquote|<value|inc-theorem>>><reset-corollary>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Notice the trick with <markup|quasi> and <markup|unquote> in order to take
  into account additional action which might have been undertaken by the
  previous value of the macro <markup|inc-theorem>.

  The following code from <verbatim|number-long-article.ts> is used in order
  to prefix all standard environments with the number of the current section:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|section-clean|<macro|<reset-subsection><reset-std-env>>>>

    <inactive*|<assign|display-std-env|<macro|nr|<section-prefix><arg|nr>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  glossaries. Other types of automatically generated content like lists of
  figures are usually similar to one of the four above types (in the case of
  lists of figures, we use glossaries). The rendering of the entire sections
  which contain the bibliographies, tables of contents, <abbr|etc.> are

  <tmdoc-title|Page breaking primitives>

  The physical lines in a document are broken into pages in a way similar to
  how paragraphs are hyphenated into lines. The page breaker performs
  <def-index|page filling>, it tries to distribute page items evenly so text
  runs to the bottom of every page. It also tries to avoid <def-index|orphans
  and widows>, which are single or pairs of soft lines separated from the
  rest of their paragraph by a page break, but these can be produced when
  there is no better solution.

    Set an infinite page breaking penalty for the current line, similarly to
    <markup|no-break>.

    Forbidden page breaking points are overridden by ``new page'' and ``page
    break'' primitives.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|no-page-break*><explain-synopsis|prevent automatic page

  <|explain>
    Similar to <markup|no-page-break>, but set the page breaking penalty of
    the previous line.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|new-page><explain-synopsis|start a new page after this
    line>
  <|explain>
    Cause the next line to appear on a new page, without filling the current
    page. The page breaker will not try to position the current line at the
    bottom of the page.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|new-page*><explain-synopsis|start a new page before this
    line>
  <|explain>
    Similar to <markup|new-page>, but start the new page before the current
    line. This directive is appropriate to use in chapter headings.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|page-break><explain-synopsis|force a page break after this
    line>
  <|explain>
    Force a page break after the current line. A forced page break is
    different from a new page, the page breaker will try to position the
    current line at the bottom of the page.

    Use only to fine-tune the automatic page breaking. Ideally, this should
    be a hint similar to <markup|line-break>, but this is implemented as a
    directive, use only with extreme caution.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|page-break*><explain-synopsis|force a page break before
    this line>
  <|explain>
    Similar to <markup|page-break>, but force a page break before the current
    line.
  </explain>

  When several ``new page'' and ``page break'' directives apply to the same
  point in the document, only the first one is effective. Any
  <markup|new-page> or <markup|page-break> after the first one in a line is
  ignored. Any <markup|new-page> or <markup|page-break> in a line overrides
  any <markup|new-page*> or <markup|page-break*> in the following line. Any
  <markup|new-page*> or <markup|page-break*> after the first one in a line is
  ignored.

  <tmdoc-title|Editing objects>

  Any of the modes which allows for the insertion of new objects (points,
  lines, polygons, etc.) also allows you to directly edit existing objects.
  More precisely, as soon as you go over an existing object with your mouse,
  then the control points for that object will be highlighted automatically.
  Several editing operations are supported:

  <\description>
    <item*|Moving control points>When your mouse is sufficiently close to a
    control point, then it will be possible to drag and drop the control
    point to somewhere else using the left mouse button.

    <item*|Inserting new control points>For objects with an arbitrary number
    of control points, such as broken lines, polygons, splines and closed
    splines, it is possible to insert new points on existing edges. In order
    to do so, move the mouse pointer on the edge where you want to insert a
    new point; the two neighbouring control points should be highlighted.
    Then insert a new point drag and move it around using drag and drop for
    the first mouse button.

    <item*|Removing control points>Using the middle mouse button, it is
    possible to remove control points (and eventually the object itself).

    <item*|Removing the entire object>Using the middle mouse button while
    simultaneously pressing the shift key <key|S-> removes the entire object
    which is currently highlighted.
  </description>

  While editing, it should also be noticed that <TeXmacs> attempts to
  automatically <em|snap> the mouse pointer to control points or edges of
  existing objects, as well as to intersection points of two curves and
  points on the grid. This makes it possible to quickly draw complex pictures
  which are exact, and not merely exact up to one or more pixels (and ugly
  when magnified or printed). Around boxes with text or mathematical
  formulas, there are also eight invisible control points to which <TeXmacs>
  will attempt to snap the mouse pointer. This makes it easier to draw
  diagrams as in figure<nbsp><reference|diagram-fig> below.

  Graphical objects are drawn in a specific <em|stacking order> which has the
  effect that certain objects may be hidden by other objects. Using
  <shortcut|(graphics-zmove 'closer)> and <shortcut|(graphics-zmove
  'farther)>, you may move the currently highlighted object closer to or
  farther away from the eye for this stacking order. In a similar vein,
  certain control points may become unaccessible, because hidden by closer
  control points. In that case, you may use <key|tab> to cycle through all
  possibilities for the current cursor position.

  <tmdoc-title|Spreadsheets>

  <TeXmacs> provides rudimentary spreadsheet-like facilities with the
  advantage that the computations can be carried out using any of the
  plug-ins that can be used as a scripting language. In order to use the
  spreadsheet facilities, you should therefore start with the selection of a
  scripting language in the menu <menu|Document|Scripts>.

  As soon as you have selecting a scripting language, such as <name|Maxima>,
  then you may enter a new spreadsheet using <menu|Insert|Table|Textual
  spreadsheet> or <menu|Insert|Table|Numeric spreadsheet>. You may edit the
  spreadsheet as an ordinary table, except that the <key|return> key will
  attempt to reevaluate the cells of the table.

  In addition, when preceding the contents of a cell by =, then cell will be
  considered as an input-output switch. More precisely, the input is a
  formula which will be evaluated using the current scripting language. After
  the evaluation, only the result of the evaluation is shown in the cell.
  After pressing <key|return> a second time in the cell, it will be possible
  switch back and edit the input. In the formulas, one may refer to the
  others using names such as <samp|c5> for the third row and the fifth
  column.

  <\example>
    On the left-hand side of the figure below, we have displayed a simple
    table with formulas for evaluating the sums of the first two items of
    each row. On the right-hand side, we have shown the result after
    evaluation.

    The cells may contain mathematical formulas and the spreadsheet may take
    advantage of any of the capacities of the scripting language. For
    instance, the figure below demonstrates another possible use of

  </example>

  <TeXmacs> supports a few special notations for applying operations on all
  cells in a subtable. For instance, as in <name|Excel>, one may use the
  notation <samp|c3:d5> for indicating all cells <samp|c3>, <samp|c4>,
  <samp|c5>, <samp|d3>, <samp|d4>, <samp|d5> in the block from <samp|c3> to
  <samp|d5>. An alternative notation <cell-commas> for <samp|:> can be
  entered by typing <key|, ,>. In a similar way, one may enter the special
  notation <cell-plusses> by typing <key|+ +>. For instance,
  <samp|c3<cell-plusses>d5> stands for the sum of all cells between <samp|c3>
  and <samp|d5>.

  <\example>
    The figure below shows an example on how to use taking sums of cells.
    Notice that empty cells count for zero.

  </example>

  Notice that copying and pasting of subtables works in the same way as for
  ordinary tables, with the additional features that the names of the cells
  and references to cells in the formulas are renumbered automatically.
  Similarly, automatic renumbering is used when inserting new columns or
  rows, or when removing existing columns or rows.

  We also notice that field references can be used inside spreadsheet cells
  in order to refer to some computational markup outside the table.
  Inversely, each spreadsheet also carries an invisible <samp|Ref> field
  which can be edited by deactivating the spreadsheet or from the focus bar
  (when selecting the entire spreadsheet). The <samp|Ref> field of the
  spreadsheet is used as a prefix for refering to the contents of cells
  outside the table or from within other spreadsheets. For instance, if
  <samp|Ref> equals <samp|sheet>, then <samp|sheet-c4> will refer to the
  field <samp|c4> inside the spreadsheet.

  <tmdoc-title|Fundamental primitives>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|document|par-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|par-n><explain-synopsis|vertical
  sequence of paragraphs>>
    This primitive is used for sequences of logical paragraphs. A simple,
    plain text document is made of a sequence of paragraphs. For instance,

    <\tm-fragment>
      A simple document.

      Made of several paragraphs. The second paragraph is very long, so that
      it is hyphenated across several line.
    </tm-fragment>

    is internally represented as a <markup|document> with two subtrees:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|src-special|raw|<\inactive*>
        A simple document.

        Made of several paragraphs. The second paragraph is very long, so
        that it is hyphenated across several line.
      </inactive*>>
    </tm-fragment>

    From the visual point of view, different paragraphs are often separated
    by some vertical whitespace. Alternatively, new paragraphs are indicated
    through the use of an additional indentation. The root of a <TeXmacs>
    document is usually a <markup|document> node.

    The <markup|document> tag is also used for marking multi-paragraph
    content inside other tags, such lists or theorem-like environments.
    Environments which require the use of a <markup|document> tag for at
    least one argument are called ``block environments''.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|paragraph|unit-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|unit-n><explain-synopsis|vertical
  sequence of paragraph units>>
    This not yet implemented primitive is a variant of <markup|document>.
    While a document is made up of logical paragraphs, a paragraph is made up
    of ``paragraph units''. From a visual point of view, different paragraphs
    are singled out using some additional space or indentation. New paragraph
    units rather correspond to simple new lines. Typically, displayed
    equations are also paragraph units in a larger paragraph.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|concat|item-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|item-n><explain-synopsis|horizontal
  sequence of inline markup>>
    This primitive is used for sequences of line items, also called ``inline
    content''. For instance,

    <\tm-fragment>
      Some <em|emphasized> text.
    </tm-fragment>

    is internally represented as:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|src-special|raw|<inactive*|Some <em|emphasized> text.>>
    </tm-fragment>

    The <markup|concat> operator is essential to put compound structures in
    trees taking multiple parameters. For example, let us place the previous
    fragment in a multi-paragraph context:

    <\tm-fragment>
      Multiple paragraphs.

      Some <em|emphasized> text.
    </tm-fragment>

    In this example, we need the <markup|concat> tag in order to indicate
    that ``Some <em|emphasized> text.'' correponds to a single paragraph:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|src-special|raw|<\inactive*>
        A simple document.

        Some <em|emphasized> text.
      </inactive*>>
    </tm-fragment>

    Notice that block tags like <markup|document> may contain inline tags
    such as <markup|concat> as its children, but not <em|vice versa>. In
    order to typeset line content before or after block content, one has to
    use the <markup|surround> tag below.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|surround|left|right|body><explain-synopsis|surround block
    content with inline content>
  <|explain>
    Although it is not possible in <TeXmacs> to use block content inside
    horizontal concatenations, it is sometimes useful to add some additional
    inline content before or after a block environment. The <markup|surround>
    primitive serves this purpose, by adding a <src-arg|left> and
    <src-arg|right> surrounding to some block content <src-arg|body>. For
    instance,

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\inactive*>
        <\surround|<active*|<with|mode|math|<with|color|red|\<lightning\>>>
        >|>
          <\theorem>
            <active*|Given <with|mode|math|P\<in\>\<bbb-T\>{F}> and
            <with|mode|math|f\<less\>g\<in\>\<bbb-T\>> with
            <with|mode|math|P(f)*P(g)\<less\>0>, there exists an
            <with|mode|math|h\<in\>\<bbb-T\>> with <with|mode|math|P(h)=0>.>
          </theorem>
        </surround>
      </inactive*>
    </tm-fragment>

    produces

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\surround|<with|mode|math|<with|color|red|\<lightning\>>> |>
        <\theorem>
          Given <with|mode|math|P\<in\>\<bbb-T\>{F}> and
          <with|mode|math|f\<less\>g\<in\>\<bbb-T\>> with
          <with|mode|math|P(f)*P(g)\<less\>0>, there exists an
          <with|mode|math|h\<in\>\<bbb-T\>> with <with|mode|math|P(h)=0>.
        </theorem>
      </surround>
    </tm-fragment>

    In general, the <markup|surround> is mainly used in style files, but it
    occasionally turns out to be useful in regular documents as well.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Layout issues>

  As a general rule, <apply|TeXmacs> takes care of the layout of your text.
  Therefore, although we did not want to forbid this possibility, we do not
  encourage you to typeset your document visually. For instance, you should
  not insert spaces or blank lines as substitutes for horizontal and vertical
  spaces between words and lines; instead, additional space should be
  inserted explicitly using <submenu|Insert|space>. This will make your text
  more robust in the sense that you will not have to reconsider the layout
  when performing some minor changes, which affect line or page breaking, or
  major changes, such as changing the document style.

  Several types of explicit spacing commands have been implemented. First of
  all, you can insert rigid spaces of given widths and heights. Horizontal
  spaces do not have a height and are either stretchable or not. The length
  of a stretchable spaces depends on the way a paragraph is hyphenated.
  Furthermore, it is possible to insert tabular spaces. Vertical spaces may
  be inserted either at the start or the end of a paragraph: the additional
  vertical space between two paragraphs is the maximum of the vertical space
  after the first one and the vertical space before the second one (contrary
  to <apply|TeX>, this prevents from superfluous space between two
  consecutive theorems).

  As to the paragraph layout, the user may specify the paragraph style
  (justified, left ragged, centered or right ragged), the paragraph margins
  and the left (resp. right) indentation of the first (resp. last) line of a
  paragraph. The user also controls the spaces between paragraphs and
  successive lines in paragraphs.

  You can specify the page layout in the <submenu|Document|page> menu. First
  of all, you can specify the way pages are displayed on the screen: when
  selecting ``paper'' as page type in <subsubmenu|Document|page|type>, you
  explicitly see the page breaks. By default, the page type is ``papyrus'',
  which avoids page breaking during the preparation of your document. The
  ``automatic'' page type assumes that your paper size is exactly the size of
  your window. The page margins and text width are specified in
  <subsubmenu|Document|page|layout>. Often, it is convenient to reduce the
  page margins for usage on the screen; this can be done in
  <subsubmenu|Document|page|screen layout>.

  <tmdoc-title|Introduction>

  <TeXmacs> offers high quality converters to and from <LaTeX>. For simple
  documents, it suffices to use <menu|File|Export|LaTeX> <abbr|resp.>
  <menu|File|Import|LaTeX>. However, in order to take fully advantage out of
  the converts, it is necessary to understand some particularities of
  <LaTeX>.

  First of all, it should be emphasized that <TeX>/<LaTeX> is <em|not> a data
  format. Indeed, <TeX> is a programming language for which no real
  standardization process has taken place: valid <TeX> programs are defined
  as those which are recognized by the <TeX> program. In particular, there
  exists no formal specification of the language and it is not even clear
  what should be considered to be a valid <TeX> document. As a consequence of
  this, a converter from <LaTeX> to <TeXmacs> can only be designed to be 100%
  reliable for a (substantial) subset of the <TeX>/<LaTeX> language.

  A second important point is that publishers usually impose additional
  constraints on the kind of <LaTeX> documents which they accept for
  submissions. For instance, certain journals provide additional macros for
  title information, theorems, specific layout features, etc. Other journals
  forbid for the definition of new macros in the preamble. Since <TeXmacs> is
  <em|not> a <TeX>/<LaTeX> front-end, it is difficult for us to write
  specific code for each possible journal. Nevertheless, some general
  principles do hold, and we will describe below how to customize the
  converter so as to make the conversion process as simple and automatic as
  possible.

  Another point which should be stressed is that <TeXmacs> aims to provide a
  strict superset of <TeX>/<LaTeX>. This not completely the case yet, but it
  is already true that many features in <TeXmacs> admit no direct analogues
  in <TeX>/<LaTeX> or one of its packages. This is for instance the case for
  computer algebra sessions, folding, actions, graphics and presentations,
  but also for certain typsetting constructs, like vertical alignment and
  background filling in tables. When using such additional features, you
  should be prepared that they will not be converted correctly to <LaTeX>.

  Finally, when preparing journal papers with <TeXmacs>, <em|please> consider
  submitting them in <TeXmacs> format. The editors of the journal will
  probably force you to convert your paper to <LaTeX>, but repeated
  submissions in <TeXmacs> format will put pressure upon them to accept this
  new format.

  <tmdoc-title|Summary of the configuration options for plug-ins>

  As explained before, the <scheme> configuration file
  <verbatim|<em|myplugin>/progs/init-<em|myplugin>.scm> of a plug-in with
  name <verbatim|<em|plugin>> should contain an instruction of the type

  <\scm-code>
    (plugin-configure <em|myplugin>

    \ \ <em|configuration-options>)
  </scm-code>

  Here follows a list of the available <verbatim|<em|configuration-options>>:

  <\description-dash>
    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:winpath <em|package-path>
    <em|inner-bin-path>)>>>Specify where to search for the plug-in under
    windows. The <verbatim|<em|package-path>> is the usual place where the
    plug-in is installed. The <verbatim|<em|inner-bin-path>> is the place
    where to look for the binary executable corresponding to the plug-in,
    relative to the <verbatim|<em|package-path>>.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:winpath <em|package-path>
    <em|inner-bin-path>)>>>Analoguous to <verbatim|:winpath>, but under
    MacOS.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:require
    <em|condition>)>>>This option specifies a sanity
    <verbatim|<em|condition>> which needs to be satisfied by the plug-in.
    Usually, it is checked that certain binaries or libraries are present on
    your system. If the condition fails, then <TeXmacs> will continue as
    whether your plug-in did not exist. In that case, further configuration
    is aborted. The <verbatim|:require> option usually occurs first in the
    list of configuration options.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:versions
    <em|version-cmd>)>>>This option specifies a <scheme> expression
    <verbatim|<em|version-cmd>> which evaluates to a list of available
    versions of the plug-in.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:setup <em|cmd>)>>>This
    command is only executed when the version of the plug-in changed from one
    execution of <TeXmacs> to another one. This occurs mainly when installing
    new versions of <TeXmacs> or helper applications.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:launch <em|shell-cmd>)>>>This
    option specifies that the plug-in is able to evaluate expressions over a
    pipe, using a helper application which is launched using the
    shell-command <verbatim|<em|shell-cmd>>.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:link <em|lib-name>
    <em|export-struct> <em|options>)>>>This option is similar to
    <verbatim|:launch>, except that the extern application is now linked
    dynamically. For more information, see the section about <hlink|dynamic
    linking|../interface/interface-dynlibs.en.tm>.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:session
    <em|menu-name>)>>>This option indicates that the plug-in supports an
    evaluator for interactive shell sessions. An item
    <verbatim|<em|menu-item>> will be inserted to the <menu|Insert|Session>
    menu in order to launch such sessions.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:serializer
    ,<em|fun-name>)>>>If the plug-in can be used as an evaluator, then this
    option specifies the <scheme> function <verbatim|<em|fun-name>> which is
    used in order to transform <TeXmacs> trees to strings.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:commander
    ,<em|fun-name>)>>>This command is similar to the <verbatim|:serializer>
    option except that it is used to transform special commands to strings.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:tab-completion #t)>>>This
    command indicates that the plug-in supports tab-completion.

    <item*|<verbatim|<with|font-series|medium|(:test-input-done #t)>>>This
    command indicates that the plug-in provides a routine for testing whether
    the input is complete.
  </description-dash>

  It should be noticed that the configuration of the plug-in
  <verbatim|<em|myplugin>> automatically creates a few predicates:

  <\description>
    <item*|<with|font-series|medium|<verbatim|supports-<em|myplugin>?>>>Test
    whether the plug-in is fully operational (all requirements are met).

    <item*|<with|font-series|medium|<verbatim|in-<em|myplugin>?>>>Test
    whether <verbatim|<em|myplugin>> is the current programming language.

    <item*|<with|font-series|medium|<verbatim|<em|myplugin>-scripts?>>>Test
    whether <verbatim|<em|myplugin>> is the current scripting language.

  <subsection|Attribute widgets>

  In what follows <scm-arg|widget> can be anything defined using
  <scm|tm-widget>.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(centered <scm-arg|widget>)><explain-synopsis|centers
    <scm-arg|widget>>
  <|explain>
    This does just that: it centers <scm-arg|widget> with respect to the
    enclosing widget. Although we are calling this an attribute, the effect
    is achieved by using a vertical list and a horizontal one together with
    four <scm|glue> widgets. This means that in the following example, the
    first widget is actually expanded to something like the second one.

    <\session|scheme|default>
      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (tm-widget (wid1)

        \ \ (centered (text "I'm centered.")))
      <|unfolded-io>
        ((guile-user) (guile-user))
      </unfolded-io>

      <\folded-io|Scheme] >
        (tm-widget (wid2)

        \ \ (vlist

        \ \ \ \ (glue #f #f 0 10)

        \ \ \ \ (hlist

        \ \ \ \ \ \ (glue #t #f 25 0)

        \ \ \ \ \ \ (text "I'm centered.")

        \ \ \ \ \ \ (glue #t #f 25 0))

        \ \ \ \ (glue #f #f 0 10)))
      <|folded-io>
        ((guile-user) (guile-user))
      </folded-io>

      <\input|Scheme] >
        (show wid1)
      </input>

      <\input|Scheme] >
        (show wid2)
      </input>
    </session>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(resize (<scm-arg|w1> <scm-arg|w2> <scm-arg|w3>) (<scm-arg|h1>
    <scm-arg|h2> <scm-arg|h3>) <scm-arg|wid>)>

    <scm|(resize <scm-arg|w> <scm-arg|h> <scm-arg|widget>)><explain-synopsis|resizes
    <scm-arg|widget>>
  <|explain>
    These two variants resize the argument. The first one specifies a minimum
    size of <scm-arg|w1><math|\<times\>><scm-arg|h1>, a default size of
    <scm-arg|w2><math|\<times\>><scm-arg|h2> and a maximum size of
    <scm-arg|w3><math|\<times\>><scm-arg|h3>. <scm-arg|widget> will be set to
    the default size and will be allowed to resize but not beyond the bounds
    specified. The second alternative sets a fixed width and height.

    Sizes are specified as strings with a unit suffix, like in <scm|"150px">.

    <\session|scheme|default>
      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (tm-widget (wid)

        \ \ (resize "200px" "70px" (text "I'm stuck!")))
      <|unfolded-io>
        \;
      </unfolded-io>

      <\input|Scheme] >
        (show wid)
      </input>
    </session>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(padded <scm-arg|widget>)><explain-synopsis|surrounds
    <scm-arg|widget> by padding>
  <|explain>
    This sets some fixed padding around <scm-arg|widget>. As in the case of
    <scm|centered>, the effect is achieved by means of several widgets into
    which this macro expands. These are actually the same as in the example
    there, but the <scm|glue> widgets are all fixed (i.e. have all their
    expansion paramenters set to <scm|#f>).
  </explain>

  <subsection|Container or layout widgets>

  You can arrange widgets horizontally or vertically, or in two column mode
  as in forms. When running the QT version the latter will default to the OS
  standard for arranging labels and their associated input widgets in
  dialogs. Other possibilites are splitters and tabbed widgets. A very useful
  macro is <scm|dynamic>, which allows you to embed one widget into another.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(aligned <scm-arg|items-list>)><explain-synopsis|arranges items in a
    two column table>
  <|explain>
    \;
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(hlist <scm-arg|widgets>)> <explain-synopsis|arranges items
    horizontally>
  <|explain>
    \;
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(vlist <scm-arg|widgets>)><explain-synopsis|arranges items
    vertically>
  <|explain>
    \;
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(hsplit (item (<scm-arg|widget>)) (item (<scm-arg|widget>))
    ...)><explain-synopsis|arranges two items in a split panel>
  <|explain>
    \;
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tabs (tab (<scm-arg|widget>)) (tab (<scm-arg|widget>))
    ...)><explain-synopsis|a tabbed widget>
  <|explain>
    \;
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(dynamic (<scm-arg|widget>))><explain-synopsis|embeds a tm-widget
    into another one>
  <|explain>
    \;
  </explain>

  <subsection|Glue widgets>

  Besides laying out widgets in containers, you will often want to specifiy
  how they eat up space around them when the user resizes the window. By
  default (most?) widgets take up as much space as they can (i.e. they always
  expand) unless you used <scm|resize> with them or they can have their size
  set with a parameter. If you don't want this to happen you can place
  invisible spacers around them which will (if you tell them to) gobble up as
  much as they can, either vertically or horizontally or in both directions.

  <TeXmacs> provides one such basic building block:

  <\explain>
    <scm|(glue <scm-arg|horiz> <scm-arg|vert> <scm-arg|width>
    <scm-arg|height>)><explain-synopsis|possibly expanding whitespace>
  <|explain>
    The first two parameters, <scm-arg|horiz> and <scm-arg|vert>, are of
    boolean type and specify whether the <scm|glue> widget will try to expand
    horizontally or vertically when its surroundings do. The last two
    parameters, <scm-arg|width> <scm-arg|height>, either fix the size for
    non-expanding <scm|glue> or set a minimum one.

    <\session|scheme|default>
      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (tm-widget (wid1)

        \ \ (centered (text "I'm centered.")))
      <|unfolded-io>
        \;
      </unfolded-io>

      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (tm-widget (wid2)

        \ \ (vlist

        \ \ \ \ ===

        \ \ \ \ (hlist

        \ \ \ \ \ \ (glue #t #f 25 0)

        \ \ \ \ \ \ (text "I'm centered.")

        \ \ \ \ \ \ (glue #t #f 25 0))

        \ \ \ \ (glue #f #f 0 10)))
      <|unfolded-io>
        \;
      </unfolded-io>

      <\input|Scheme] >
        (show wid1)
      </input>

      <\input|Scheme] >
        (show wid2)
      </input>
    </session>
  </explain>

  In addition to the basic <scm|glue> widget, there are several convenience
  macros.

  <\explain>
    <scm|===><explain-synopsis|vertical separator>
  <|explain>
    Expands to <scm|(glue #f #f 0 5)>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|======><explain-synopsis|big vertical separator>
  <|explain>
    Expands to <scm|(glue #f #f 0 15)>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|//><explain-synopsis|horizontal separator>
  <|explain>
    Expands to <scm|(glue #f #f 5 0)>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|///><explain-synopsis|big horizontal separator>
  <|explain>
    Expands to <scm|(glue #f #f 15 0)>.

  Tables offer a general way to align markup in complex manners. They can be

  programs or the design of web sites. <TeXmacs> provides a wide variety of
  parameters to control the precise layout of tables and its cells.

  <tmdoc-title|A <tt|tmfs> primer>

  <subsection|The <TeXmacs> filesystem>

  Many things in <TeXmacs> can be referenced through a <abbr|URI> with
  <tt|tmfs> as schema. Examples of entities in this system are buffers, views
  and windows or at a higher level help buffers and search results. A
  <TeXmacs> <abbr|URI> follows the format:

  <center|<tt|tmfs://handler[/query]>>

  Requests to open <abbr|URI>s such as these are sent to a <em|handler>,
  which actually is a set of procedures implementing the basic operations
  related to the type of content they handle: loading the content, saving it
  (if possible or necessary), setting the window title and establishing
  access permissions are the basic operations. Predefined handlers which the
  user usually encounters are <tt|grep>, <tt|help>, <tt|history>,
  <tt|revision> and <tt|apidoc>: they accept a query representing search
  strings, files or help pages and render results in the appropriate language
  into a new buffer. The <em|query> is a string in the usual format
  <tt|variable1=value1&variable2=value2>. Its parsing can be done using
  <scm|query-ref>.

  Situations where using this system makes more sense than regular documents
  are for instance documentation, which must be chosen from several languages
  and possibly be compiled on the fly from various sources (see module
  <tt|<hlink|doc.apidoc|tmfs://apidoc/type=module&what=doc.apidoc>> and
  related modules) and automatically generated content, like that resulting
  from interacting from an external system for version control of documents
  (see handler <tt|version> in module <tt|<hlink|version.version-tmfs|tmfs://apidoc/type=module&what=version.version-tmfs>>).

  <subsection|Implementing a handler>

  The definition of a handler is done via <scm|tmfs-handler> or with the
  convenience macros <scm|tmfs-load-handler>, <scm|tmfs-save-handler>,
  <scm|tmfs-permission-handler> and <scm|tmfs-title-handler>.

  Below we'll implement a basic load handler named <tt|simple> which will
  accept two sorts of arguments: <scm|type> and <scm|what>. We shall use two
  procedures, one to handle the requests, another to create the document.

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\folded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-define (simple-load header body)

      \ \ `(document

      \ \ \ \ \ (TeXmacs ,(texmacs-version))

      \ \ \ \ \ (style (tuple "generic"))

      \ \ \ \ \ (body (document (section ,header) ,body))))
    <|folded-io>
      \;
    </folded-io>
  </session>

  As you can see, we don't do much other than creating a <TeXmacs> document.
  The load handler won't be complicated either. We only parse the query
  string with the help of <scm|query-ref> and then display one of three
  possible buffers.

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\folded-io|Scheme] >
      (tmfs-load-handler (simple qry)

      \ \ (let ((type (query-ref qry "type"))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (what (query-ref qry "what")))

      \ \ \ \ (tm-\<gtr\>stree

      \ \ \ \ \ \ (cond ((== type "very") (simple-load "Very simple" what))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ((== type "totally") (simple-load "Totally
      simple" what))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (else (simple-load "Error"

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (string-append "Query
      unknown: " what)))))))
    <|folded-io>
      \;
    </folded-io>
  </session>

  We can test this right away with:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input>
      Scheme]\ 
    <|input>
      (load-buffer "tmfs://simple/type=very&what=example")
    </input>
  </session>

  Or embedded in a document using tags like <markup|hlink> and
  <markup|branch>: <hlink|click here to test
  it|tmfs://simple/type=very&what=example>.

  You can set read/write permissions implementing a <em|permission handler>,
  and the window's title using a <em|title handler>:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\folded-io|Scheme] >
      (tmfs-permission-handler (simple name type)\ 

      \ \ (display* "Name= " name "\\nType= " type "\\n")

      \ \ #t)
    <|folded-io>
      \;
    </folded-io>

    <\folded-io|Scheme] >
      (tmfs-title-handler (simple qry doc) "Simple handler - Some title
      here")
    <|folded-io>
      \;
    </folded-io>
  </session>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tmfs-load-handler (<scm-arg|name> <scm-arg|qry>)
    <scm-arg|body>)><explain-synopsis|define load handler for @name>
  <|explain>
    A <em|load handler> for <scm-arg|name> is invoked when <TeXmacs> receives
    a request to open a <abbr|URI> of type
    <tt|tmfs://<scm-arg|name>/<scm-arg|qry>>. The <scm-arg|body> of the
    handler is passed <tt|qry> as parameter (see <scm|query-ref>) and must
    return a complete <TeXmacs> buffer. Consider the following example:

    <\scm-code>
      (tmfs-load-handler (id qry)

      \ \ `(document

      \ \ \ \ \ (TeXmacs ,(texmacs-version))

      \ \ \ \ \ (style (tuple "generic"))

      \ \ \ \ \ (body (document ,qry))))
    </scm-code>

    This will open <abbr|URI>s with the format
    <tt|tmfs://id/whatever_arguments>.

    Creation of the buffer contents may be simplified using the procedures
    defined in module <tt|<hlink|kernel.gui.gui-markup|tmfs://sapi/type=module&what=kernel.gui.gui-markup>>.

  </explain|Given a <scm-arg|qry> string of type
  <tt|variable1=value1&variable2=value2>, <scm|query-ref> will return
  <tt|value1> for an <scm-arg|arg> value of <scm|value1>, etc.>

  <subsection|Installing the handler>

  In order to make your handler available from any menu item or document upon
  startup, you must add it to the initialization process, that is to
  <tt|init-texmacs.scm> or <tt|my-init-texmacs.scm>, using the macro
  <scm|lazy-tmfs-handler>. This will delay loading of your code either until
  it is required or <TeXmacs> is idle waiting for user input.

  <\remark>
    \ The keywords <tt|buffer>, <tt|view> and <tt|window> may not be used as
    names for handlers since they are used internally by <TeXmacs>.
  </remark>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(lazy-tmfs-handler <scm-arg|module>
    <scm-arg|handler>)><explain-synopsis|lazily install a tmfs handler>
  <|explain>
    Inform <TeXmacs> that <scm-arg|handler> is available in module
    <scm-arg|module>. <scm-arg|module> must be a list of symbols (like
    <scm|(kernel gui gui-markup)>) representing the <scheme> modle wher
    you'll have defined your handler using <scm|tmfs-handler> or with the
    convenience macros <scm|tmfs-load-handler>, <scm|tmfs-save-handler>,
    <scm|tmfs-permission-handler> and <scm|tmfs-title-handler>.

  <tmdoc-title|Using list environments>

  The standard <TeXmacs> lists are defined in <tmdtd|std-list>. The
  unnumbered lists environments are:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|itemize|body>>
    The tag before each item depends on the nesting depth.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|itemize-minus|body>>
    Uses <with|mode|math|-> for the tag.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|itemize-dot|body>>
    Uses <with|mode|math|\<bullet\>> for the tag.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|itemize-arrow|body>>
    Uses <with|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>> for the tag.
  </explain>

  The following environments can be used for producing numbered lists:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate|body>>
    The kind of number before each item depends on the nesting depth.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-numeric|body>>
    Number the items by 1, 2, 3, <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-roman|body>>
    Number the items by i, ii, iii, <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-Roman|body>>
    Number the items by I, II, III, <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-alpha|body>>
    Number the items by a), b), c), <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-Alpha|body>>
    Number the items by A), B), C), <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  The following environments can be used for descriptive lists:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description|body>>
    The environment for default descriptive lists (usually
    <markup|description-compact>).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description-compact|body>>
    Align the left hand sides of the items in the list and put their
    descriptions shortly behind it.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description-dash|body>>
    Similar to <markup|description-compact>, but use a  to separate each
    item from its description.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description-align|body>>
    Align the left hand sides of the descriptions, while aligning the items
    to the right.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description-long|body>>
    Put the items and their descriptions on distinct lines.
  </explain>

  New items in a list are indicated through the <markup|item> tag or the
  <markup|item*> tag in the case of descriptions. The <markup|item> tag takes
  no arguments and the <markup|item*> tag one argument. When using the
  experimental <tmdtd|structured-list> package, these tags may take an
  optional body argument. In the future, all list items should become
  structured.

  By default, items in sublists are numbered in the same way as usual lists.
  Each list environment <markup|<em|list>> admits a variant
  <markup|<em|list>*> whose items are prefixed by the last item in the parent
  list. Of course, this feature can be used recursively.

  <tmdoc-title|Miscellaneous features>

  Several other features are supported in order to write interfaces between
  <TeXmacs> and extern applications. Some of these are very hairy or quite
  specific. Let us briefly describe a few miscellaneous features:

  <paragraph*|Interrupts>

  The ``stop'' icon can be used in order to interrupt the evaluation of some
  input. When pressing this button, <TeXmacs> will just send a
  <verbatim|SIGINT> signal to your application. It expects your application
  to finish the output as usual. In particular, you should close all open
  <render-key|DATA_BEGIN>-blocks.

  <paragraph*|Testing whether the input is complete>

  Some systems start a multiline input mode as soon as you start to define a
  function or when you enter an opening bracket without a matching closing
  bracket. <TeXmacs> allows your application to implement a special predicate
  for testing whether the input is complete. First of all, this requires you
  to specify the configuration option

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (:test-input-done #t)
  </scheme-fragment>

  As soon as you will press <shortcut|(kbd-return)> in your input, <TeXmacs> will
  then send the command

  <\quotation>
    <\framed-fragment>
      <\verbatim>
        <render-key|DATA_COMMAND>(input-done? <em|input-string>)<shortcut|(kbd-return)>
      </verbatim>
    </framed-fragment>
  </quotation>

  Your application should reply with a message of the form

  <\quotation>
    <\framed-fragment>
      <verbatim|<render-key|DATA_BEGIN>scheme:<em|done><render-key|DATA_END>>
    </framed-fragment>
  </quotation>

  where <verbatim|<em|done>> is either <scm|#t> or <scm|#f>. The
  <verbatim|multiline> plug-in provides an example of this mechanism (see in
  particular the file <example-plugin-link|multiline/src/multiline.cpp>).

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Content-based tags>

  The simplest examples of structure in a text are content-based tags. In
  <apply|menu|Insert|content tags> you see a list of them. Content based tags
  indicate that a given portion of text is of a particular kind or that it
  serves a specific purpose. For instance, important text should be marked
  using the <markup|strong> tag. Its default rendering uses a bold type face,
  like in this <strong|strong text>. However, strong text might be rendered
  in a different way according to the document style. For instance, strong
  text may be rendered in a different color on transparencies for
  presentations. Here follows a short list of the most common content-based
  tags and their purpose:

  <tmdoc-title|Glossaries>

  The following macros may be used in the main text for inserting glossary
  entries.

    <src-arg|explanation>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|glossary-line|entry>>
    Insert a glossary <src-arg|entry> without a page number.
  </explain>

  The following macros can be redefined if you want to customize the
  rendering of the glossary:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|glossary-1|entry|where>>
    Macro for rendering a glossary entry and its corresponding page
    number(s).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|glossary-2|entry|explanation|where>>
    Macro for rendering a glossary entry, its explanation, and its page
    number.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|glossary-dots>>

<style|<tuple|tmdoc|english>>

  <tmdoc-title|The typesetting process>

  In order to understand the <TeXmacs> document format well, it is useful to
  have a basic understanding about how documents are typeset by the editor.
  The typesetter mainly rewrites logical <TeXmacs> trees into physical
  <em|boxes>, which can be displayed on the screen or on paper (notice that
  boxes actually contain more information than is necessary for their
  rendering, such as information about how to position the cursor inside the
  box or how to make selections).

  The global typesetting process can be subdivided into two major parts
  (which are currently done at the same stage, but this may change in the
  future): evaluation of the <TeXmacs> tree using the stylesheet language,
  and the actual typesetting.

  The <hlink|typesetting primitives|../regular/regular.en.tm> are designed to
  be very fast and they are built-in into the editor. For instance, one has
  typesetting primitives for horizontal concatenations (<markup|concat>),
  page breaks (<markup|page-break>), mathematical fractions (<markup|frac>),
  hyperlinks (<markup|hlink>), and so on. The precise rendering of many of
  the typesetting primitives may be customized through the <hlink|built-in
  environment variables|../environment/environment.en.tm>. For instance, the
  environment variable <src-var|color> specifies the current color of
  objects, <src-var|par-left> the current left margin of paragraphs,
  <abbr|etc.>

  The <hlink|stylesheet language|../stylesheet/stylesheet.en.tm> allows the
  user to write new primitives (macros) on top of the built-in primitives. It
  contains primitives for definining macros, conditional statements,
  computations, delayed execution, <abbr|etc.> The stylesheet language also
  provides a special <markup|extern> tag which offers you the full power of
  the <scheme> extension language in order to write macros.

  It should be noticed that user-defined macros have two aspects. On the one
  hand they usually perform simple rewritings. For instance, the macro

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|seq|<macro|var|from|to|<active*|<math|<inactive*|<arg|var>><rsub|<inactive*|<arg|from>>>,\<ldots\>,<inactive*|<arg|var>><rsub|<inactive*|<arg|to>>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  is a shortcut in order to produce sequences like
  <math|a<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,a<rsub|n>>. When macros perform simple rewritings
  like in this example, the children <src-arg|var>, <src-arg|from> and
  <src-arg|to> of the <markup|seq> tag remain <em|accessible> from within the
  editor. In other words, you can position the cursor inside them and modify
  them. User defined macros also have a synthetic or computational aspect.
  For instance, the dots of a <markup|seq> tag as above cannot be edited by
  the user. Similarly, the macro

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|square|<macro|x|<times|<arg|x>|<arg|x>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  serves an exclusively computational purpose. As a general rule, synthetic
  macros are sometimes easier to write, but the more accessability is
  preserved, the more natural it becomes for the user to edit the markup.

  It should be noticed that <TeXmacs> also produces some auxiliary data as a
  byproduct of the typesetting product. For instance, the correct values of
  references and page numbers, as well as tables of contents, indexes,
  <abbr|etc.> are determined during the typesetting stage and memorized at a
  special place. Even though auxiliary data may be determined automatically
  from the document, it may be expensive to do so (one typically has to
  retypeset the document). When the auxiliary data are computed by an
  external plug-in, then it may even be impossible to perform the
  recomputations on certain systems. For these reasons, auxiliary data are
  carefully memorized and stored on disk when you save your work.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Generating an index>

  For the generation of an index, you first have to put index entries in your
  document using <apply|menu|Insert|Link|Index entry>. At a second stage, you
  must put your cursor at the place where you want your index to be generated
  and click on <apply|menu|Insert|Automatic|Index>. The index is than generated
  in a similar way as the table of contents.

  In the <apply|menu|Insert|Link|Index entry> menu, you find several types of
  index entries. The simplest are ``main'', ``sub'', ``subsub'', which are
  macros with one, two and three arguments respectively. Entries of the form
  ``sub'' and ``subsub'' may be used to subordinate index entries with
  respect to other ones.

  A complex index entry takes four arguments. The first one is a key how the
  entry has to be sorted and it must be a ``tuple'' (created using
  <key|inactive \<less\>>) whose first component is the main category, the
  second a subcategory, etc. The second argument of a complex index entry is
  either blank or ``strong'', in which case the page number of your entry
  will appear in a bold typeface. The third argument is usually blank, but if
  you create two index entries with the same non-blank third argument, then
  this will create a ``range'' of page numbers. The fourth argument, which is
  again a tuple, is the entry itself.

  It is also possible to create an index line without a page number using
  ``interject'' in <apply|menu|Insert|Link|Index entry>. The first argument
  of this macro is a key for how to sort the index line. The second argument
  contains the actual text. This construct may be useful for creating
  different sections ``A'', ``B'', etc. in your index.

  <tmdoc-title|Creating labels, links and references>

  You may create a new inactive label using <shortcut|(make-label)> or
  <menu|Insert|Link|Label> and a reference to this label using <shortcut|(make 'reference)> or
  <menu|Insert|Link|Reference>. After typing the name of the label or
  reference, remember to hit <shortcut|(kbd-return)> in order to
  <hlink|activate|../text/keyboard/man-hybrid.en.tm> it. You may also type
  the first characters of the name of a reference and use the <key|tab>
  key in order to automatically complete it.

  You should be careful to put the label at a point where its number will be
  correct. When labeling sections, the recommended place is just after the
  sectional tag. When labeling single equations (created using
  <menu|Insert|Mathematics|Equation>), the recommended place is at the start
  inside the equation. When labeling multiple equations (created using
  <menu|Insert|Mathematics|Equations>), you must put the labels just behind
  the equation numbers. Recall that you may use <shortcut|(numbered-toggle (focus-tree))> in order to
  transform an unnumbered environment or equation into a numbered one, and
  vice versa.

  It is possible to create hyperlinks to other documents using
  <key|inactive \<gtr\>> or <menu|Insert|Link|Hyperlink>. The first field of the
  hyperlink is the associated text, which is displayed in blue when
  activated. The second field contains the name of a document, which may be
  on the web. As is usual for hyperlinks, a link of the form
  <verbatim|#<with|font-shape|italic|label>> points to a label in the same
  document and a link of the form <verbatim|<with|font-shape|italic|url>#<with|font-shape|italic|label>>
  points to a label in the document located at
  <verbatim|<with|font-shape|italic|url>>.

  In a similar fashion, an action may be associated to a piece of text or
  graphics using <key|inactive *> or <menu|Insert|Link|Action>. The second field
  now contains a Guile/Scheme script command, which is executed whenever you
  double click on the text, after its activation. For security reasons, such
  scripts are not always accepted. By default, you are prompted for
  acceptation; this default behaviour may be changed in
  <menu|Options|Security>. Notice that the Guile/Scheme command\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ (system "shell-command")
  </verbatim>

  evaluates <verbatim|shell-command> as a shell command.

  Finally, you may directly include other documents inside a given document
  using <key|inactive i> or <menu|Insert|Link|Include>. This allows you for
  instance to include the listing of a program in your text in such a way
  that your modifications in your program are automatically reflected in your
  text.

  <tmdoc-title|General environment variables>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|mode|text><explain-synopsis|major mode>
  <|explain>
    This very important environment variable determines the <em|current
    mode>. There are four possible values: <verbatim|text> (text mode),
    <verbatim|math> (mathematical mode), <verbatim|prog> (programming mode)
    and <verbatim|src> (source mode). The behaviour of the editor (menus,
    keystrokes, typesetting, <abbr|etc.>) depends heavily on the mode. For
    example, the following code may be used in order to include a
    mathematical formula inside text:

    <\tm-fragment>
      The formula <math|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>> is well known.
    </tm-fragment>

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|The formula <math|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>> is well
      known.>
    </tm-fragment>

    Some other environment variables (mainly the language and the font) also
    depend on the current mode (in this context, the source mode always
    behaves in a similar way as the text mode). During
    copy<space|0.2spc>&<space|0.2spc>paste and
    search<space|0.2spc>&<space|0.2spc>replace operations, <TeXmacs> tries to
    preserve the mode.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|language|english>

    <var-val|math-language|texmath>

    <var-val|prog-language|scheme><explain-synopsis|language>
  <|explain>
    A second major environment variable is the <em|current language>. In
    fact, there are three such environment variables: one for each mode. The
    language in which content is written is responsible for associating a
    precise semantics to the content. This semantics is used for different
    purposes:

    <\itemize>
      <item>The language may specify rules for typesetting content. For
      instance, the text language specifies punctuation and hyphenation
      rules. Similarly the mathematical language containns spacing
      information for mathematical operators.

      <item>Several editing operations depend on the current language: when
      performing a search or replace operation, <TeXmacs> is both mode and
      language sensitive. Similarly, the text language determines the
      dictionary to use when spell-checking the document.

      <item>The language controls (among other parameters like the mode and
      the document format) the way content is being converted from one
      context to another.

      Currently, no real language-dependent conversions have been implemented
      yet. But in the future one may imagine that copying a piece of English
      text to a document written in French will perform an automatic
      translation. Similarly, a mathematical document might be converted from
      infix to postfix notation.

      <item>The programming language determines the current scripting
      language in use. Other scripting languages than <scheme> are currently
      only used for interactive sessions, but primitives like <markup|extern>
      might become language-sensitive in the future.
    </itemize>

    At the moment, the current language is mainly used as a hint for
    indicating the semantics of text: it is not required that a text written
    in English contains no spelling errors, or that a formula written in a
    mathematical language is mathematically or even syntactically correct.
    Nevertheless, the editor is intended to enforce correctness more and
    more, especially for mathematics.

    The language may be specified globally for the whole document in
    <menu|Document|Language> and locally for a piece of text in
    <menu|Format|Language>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|prog-session|default><explain-synopsis|name of programming
    session>
  <|explain>
    This environment variables is used in addition to the
    <src-var|prog-language> variable in order to determine a concrete
    implementation as well as a particular instance of the current
    programming language. For instance, in case of the
    <hlink|<name|Maxima>|../../../main/interface/cas/man-maxima.en.tm>
    language, different implementation may be used fooor the underlying
    <name|Lisp>. Similarly, one may wish to run two different instances of
    <name|Maxima> in parallel.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <label|magnification><var-val|magnification|1><explain-synopsis|magnification>
  <|explain>
    This variable determines the magnification which is applied to all
    content. Magnifications bigger than one are typically useful for
    presentations (from slides or from a laptop):

    <\tm-fragment>
      normal<htab|5mm><with|magnification|2|big><htab|5mm><with|magnification|3|huge>
    </tm-fragment>

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|normal<htab|5mm><with|magnification|2|big><htab|5mm><with|magnification|3|huge>>
    </tm-fragment>

    The magnification should not be confused with the <hlink|font
    size|env-font.en.tm#font-base-size>: contrary to the magnification, the
    font size may also affect the shapes of the glyphs. The magnification is
    usually specified for the entire document in
    <menu|Document|Magnification>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|bg-color|white><explain-synopsis|background color>
  <|explain>
    The background color for your document, as specified in
    <menu|Document|Color|Background>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|color|black><explain-synopsis|foreground color>
  <|explain>
    The current foreground color of text and graphics, as specified in
    <menu|Document|Color|Foreground> or <menu|Format|Color>. Named colors,
    like ``<verbatim|Salmon>'', are supported for different color charts:
    <hlink|<verbatim|dvips>|https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Colors#The_68_standard_colors_known_to_dvips>,
    <hlink|<verbatim|x11>|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names#Color_name_charts>
    and <hlink|<verbatim|html>|http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|preamble|false><explain-synopsis|edit source tree?>
  <|explain>
    This flag determines whether we are editing normal text or a style-sheet.
    The source tree or preamble mode may be selected in
    <menu|Document|Source|Edit source tree>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|info-flag|short><explain-synopsis|informative flags style>
  <|explain>
    This variable controls the rendering of informative flags, which are for
    instance used to indicate the locations of otherwise invisible labels or
    typesetting directives. The <src-var|info-flag> may take the values
    <verbatim|none>, <verbatim|short> and <verbatim|detailed>:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|info-flag|none|Label 1<label|flag-label-1>>,
      <with|info-flag|short|Label 2<label|flag-label-2>>,
      <with|info-flag|detailed|Label 3<label|flag-label-3>>.

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Customizing list environments>

  Lists are made up of two principal ingredients: the outer list environment
  and the inner items. List environments may either be customized by
  customizing or redefining the rendering macros for these environments, or
  defining additional list environments which match the same abstract
  interface.

  The rendering of the outer list environment is controlled by the
  <markup|render-list> macro which takes the body of the list as its
  argument. For instance, consider the following redefinition of
  <markup|render-list>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|render-list|<macro|body|<style-with|src-compact|none|<surround|<no-page-break*><vspace*|0.5fn>|<right-flush><vspace|0.5fn><no-indent*>|<with|par-left|<plus|<value|par-left>|3fn>|par-right|<plus|<value|par-right>|3fn>|<arg|body>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  This redefinition affects the rendering of all list environments (itemize,
  enumerate, <abbr|etc.>) by reducing the right margin with a length of
  <verbatim|3fn>:

  <\with|render-list|<macro|body|<surround|<no-page-break*><vspace*|0.5fn>|<right-flush><vspace|0.5fn><no-indent*>|<with|par-left|<plus|<value|par-left>|3fn>|par-right|<plus|<value|par-right>|3fn>|<arg|body>>>>>
    <\itemize>
      <item>This text, which has been made so long that it does not fit on a
      single line, is indented on the right hand side by <verbatim|3fn>.

      <\enumerate>
        <item>This text is indented by an additional <verbatim|3fn> on the
        right hand side, since it occurs inside a second list environment.
      </enumerate>

      <item>Once again: this text, which has been made so long that it does
      not fit on a single line, is indented on the right hand side by
      <verbatim|3fn>.
    </itemize>
  </with>

  In a similar way, you may customize the rendering of list items by
  redefining the macros <markup|aligned-item> and <markup|compact-item>.
  These macros both take one argument with the text of the item and render it
  either in a right-aligned way (such that subsequent text is left aligned)
  or in a left-aligned way (such that subsequent text may not be aligned).
  For instance, consider the following redefinition of <markup|aligned-item>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|aligned-item|<macro|x|<style-with|src-compact|none|<vspace*|0.5fn><with|par-first|-3fn|<yes-indent>><resize|<with|color|red|<arg|x>>|r-2.5fn||r+0.5fn|>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Then items inside all list environments with compact items will appear in
  red:

  <\with|aligned-item|<macro|x|<vspace*|0.5fn><with|par-first|-3fn|<yes-indent>><resize|<with|color|red|<arg|x>>|r-2.5fn||r+0.5fn|>>>
    <\itemize>
      <item>This list and aligned descriptions have red items.

      <\description-aligned>
        <item*|C1>First condition.

        <item*|C2>Second condition.
      </description-aligned>

      <item>The items of compact description lists are rendered using
      <markup|compact-item>.

      <\description-compact>
        <item*|Gnus and gnats>Nice beasts.

        <item*|Micros and softies>Evil beings.
      </description-compact>
    </itemize>
  </with>

  <\remark>
    The macros <markup|aligned-item> and <markup|compact-item> are required
    to produce inline content, so that they may be used in order to surround
    blocks. In particular, several other internal macros
    (<markup|aligned-space-item>, <markup|long-compact-strong-dot-item>,
    <abbr|etc.>) are based on <markup|aligned-item> and
    <markup|compact-item>, and used for the rendering of the different types
    of lists (<markup|itemize-arrow>, <markup|description-long>,
    <abbr|etc.>). In the future, we also plan to extend <markup|item> and
    <markup|item*> with a compulsory <src-arg|body> argument. When
    customizing the list environments, it is important to keep that in mind,
    so as to make your style-sheets upward compatible.
  </remark>

  The <tmdtd|std-list> <abbr|d.t.d.> also provides a macro <markup|new-list>
  to define new lists. Its syntax is <explain-macro|new-list|name|item-render|item-transform>,
  where <src-arg|name> is the name of the new list environment,
  <src-arg|item-render> an (inline) macro for rendering the item and
  <src-arg|item-transform> an additional transformation which is applied on
  the item text. For instance, the <markup|enumerate-roman> environment is
  defined by

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <new-list|enumerate-roman|<value|aligned-dot-item>|<macro|x|<number|<arg|x>|roman>>>
    </inactive*>

  <tmdoc-title|Extending the graphical user interface>

  Most of the user interface to <TeXmacs> is dynamically created from within
  the interpreted <scheme> code. New menus and buttons can be added, or the
  existing ones reused and rearranged, even the main editor can be embedded
  anywhere.

  Imagine you want to implement some feature which requires interaction with
  the user. One possible approach is to use the facility <scm|interactive>,
  which according to the user's preferences will either popoup a dialog or
  ask in the footer bar, based in metadata you provide inside your
  <scm|tm-define>'d function. See ``<hlink|Meta information and logical
  programming|../overview/overview-meta.en.tm>'' for more on this topic.
  However, automatically generated content is not always the best approach,
  so you might want to explicitly design your interface placing it inside a
  complicated dialog. The following sections should help you with this.

  <tmdoc-title|Plans for the future>

  There are many improvements to be made in the <TeXmacs> interface to
  computer algebra systems. First of all, the computer algebra sessions have
  to be improved (better hyphenation, folding, more dynamic subexpressions,
  etc.).

  As to interfaces with computer algebra systems, out main plans consist of
  providing tools for semantically safe communication between several system.
  This probably will be implemented in the form of a set of plug-ins which
  will provide conversion services.

  Small software projects usually consist of a collection of routines and

  complete overview of the program, it is a good practive to associate
  additional <em|meta-information> to the individual routines and data. This
  meta-information typically serves documentation purposes, but becomes even
  more interesting if it can be used in an automated fashion to implement
  more general additional functionality.

  The <scm|tm-define> macro supports several options for associating
  meta-information to <scheme> functions and symbols. For instance, the
  <scm|:synopsis>, <scm|:argument> and <scm|:returns> options allow you to
  associate short documentation strings to the function, its arguments and
  its return value:

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-define (square x)

    \ \ (:synopsis "Compute the square of @x")

    \ \ (:argument x "A number")

    \ \ (:returns "The square of @x")

    \ \ (* x x))
  </scm-code>

  This information is exploited by <TeXmacs> in several ways. For instance,
  the synopsis of the function can be retrieved by executing <scm|(help
  square)>. More interestingly, assuming that we defined <scm|square> as
  above, typing <shortcut|(interactive exec-interactive-command)> followed by
  <scm|square> and <shortcut|(kbd-return)> allows you to execute <scm|square>
  in an interactive way: you will be prompted for ``A number'' on the footer.
  Moreover, after typing <shortcut|(interactive exec-interactive-command)>,
  you will be able to use ``tab-completion'' in order to enter <scm|square>:
  typing <key|s q u tab> will usually complete into<nbsp><scm|square>.

  In a similar vein, the <scm|:interactive> and <scm|:check-mark> options
  allow you to specify that a given routine requires interactive user input
  or when it should give rise to a check-mark when used in a menu. For
  instance, the statement

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-property (choose-file fun text type)

    \ \ (:interactive #t))
  </scm-code>

  in the source code of <TeXmacs> states that <scm|choose-file> is an
  interactive command. As a consquence, the <menu|File|Load> entry, which is
  defined by

  <\scm-code>
    ("Load" (choose-file load-buffer "Load file" ""))
  </scm-code>

  will be followed by dots <scm|...> in the <menu|File> menu. The interesting
  point here is that, although the command <scm|choose-file> may be reused
  several times in different menu entries, we only have to specify once that
  it is an interactive command. Similarly, consider the definition

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-define (toggle-session-math-input)

    \ \ (:check-mark "v" session-math-input?)

    \ \ (session-use-math-input (not (session-math-input?))))
  </scm-code>

  Given a menu item with <scm|(toggle-session-math-input)> as its associated
  action, this definition specifies in particular that a check-mark should be
  displayed before the menu item whenever the <scm|session-math-input?>
  predicate holds.

  Another frequently used option is <scm|:secure>, which specifies that a
  given routine can be used inside <TeXmacs> documents, in particular inside
  <markup|extern> and <markup|action> macros. For instance, the default
  implementation of the <markup|fold> tag allows the user to click on the
  ``<math|<op|\<circ\>>>'' before the folded text so as to unfold the tag.
  When doing this, the scheme script <scm|mouse-unfold> is launched.
  However, for this to work, the <scm|mouse-unfold> function needs to be
  secure:

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-define mouse-unfold

    \ \ (:secure #t)

    \ \ (with-action t

    \ \ \ \ (tree-go-to t :start)

    \ \ \ \ (fold)))
  </scm-code>

  You can read more about the tags which depend on <scheme> scripts in
  ``<hlink|Invoking <scheme> scrips from <TeXmacs>
  markup|overview-start.en.tm#markup-scripts>''.\ 

  In the future, the number of options for entering meta-information is
  likely to increase. <TeXmacs> also supports an additional mechanism for the
  automatic deduction of new meta-properties from existing meta-properties.
  This mechanism is based on a less general, but more efficient form of
  <em|logical programming>. However, since it is not fully stable yet, it
  will be documented only later.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Linking your system as a dynamic library>

  Instead of connecting your system to <apply|TeXmacs> using a pipe, it is
  also possible to connect it as a dynamically linked library. Although
  communication through pipes is usually easier to implement, more robust and
  compatible with gradual output, the second option is faster.

  <section|Connections via dynamically linked libraries>

  Let us now describe the steps you have to go through in order to link your
  system as a dynamic library.

  <\enumerate>
    <item>Modify the architecture of your system in such a way that the main
    part of it can be linked as a shared library; your binary should
    typically become a very small program, which handles verbatim input and
    output, and which is linked with your shared library at runtime.

    <item>Copy the include file <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/include/TeXmacs.h>
    into the include directory of your system's source and write the
    input/output routines as required by the last <TeXmacs> communication
    protocol as explained below.

    <item>Include a line of the form:\ 

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ (package-declare "myplugin" "libmyplugin.so" "get_name_package"
      "init")
    </verbatim>

    in your file <verbatim|init-myplugin.scm> which has been described in the
    case of communication by pipes. Here <verbatim|libmyplugin.so> is the
    corresponding shared library, <verbatim|get_name_package> the function
    which will be called by <apply|TeXmacs> in order to link your system to
    <apply|TeXmacs>, and <verbatim|init> some initialization string for your
    package.

    <item>Proceed in a similar way as in the case of communication by pipes.
  </enumerate>

  <section|The <TeXmacs> communication protocol>

  The <apply|TeXmacs> communication protocol is used for linking libraries
  dynamically to <apply|TeXmacs>. The file
  <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/include/TeXmacs.h> contains the declarations of all
  data structures and functions used by the protocol. Actually, we foresee a
  succession of different protocols. Each of these protocols have the
  abstract data structures <verbatim|TeXmacs_exports> and
  <verbatim|package_exports> in common, with information about the versions
  of the protocol, <apply|TeXmacs> and your package.

  The <with|mode|math|n>-th concrete version of the communication protocol
  should provide two data structures <verbatim|TeXmacs_exports_n> and
  <verbatim|package_exports_n>. The first structure contains all routines and
  data of <apply|TeXmacs>, which may be necessary for the package. The second
  structure contains all routines and data of your package, which should be
  visible inside <apply|TeXmacs>.

  In order to link your system to <apply|TeXmacs>, you have to implement a
  function:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ package_exports* get_my_package (int version);
  </verbatim>

  This function takes the highest <apply|TeXmacs> communication protocol
  supported by your <apply|TeXmacs> system on input. It should return a
  pointer to an instance of a concrete structure
  <verbatim|package_exports_n>, where <verbatim|n> is inferior or equal to
  <verbatim|version>.

  <section|Version 1 of the <TeXmacs> communication protocol>

  In the first version of the <TeXmacs> communication protocol, your package
  should export an instance of the following data structure:\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ typedef struct package_exports_1 {<format|next line>
    \ \ \ \ \ char* version_protocol; /* "TeXmacs communication protocol 1"
    */<format|next line> \ \ \ \ \ char* version_package;<format|next line>
    \ \ \ \ \ char* (*install) (TeXmacs_exports_1* TM, char* options, char**
    errors);<format|next line> \ \ \ \ \ char* (*evaluate) (char* what, char*
    session, char** errors);<format|next line> \ \ \ \ \ char* (*execute)
    (char* what, char* session, char** errors);<format|next line> \ \ \ }
    package_exports_1;
  </verbatim>

  The string <verbatim|version_protocol> should contain <verbatim|"TeXmacs
  communication protocol 1"> and the string <verbatim|version_package> the
  version of your package.

  The routine <verbatim|install> will be called once by <apply|TeXmacs> in
  order to initialize your system with options <verbatim|options>. It
  communicates the routines exported by <apply|TeXmacs> to your system in the
  form of <verbatim|TM>. The routine should return a status message like:\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ "yourcas-version successfully linked to TeXmacs"
  </verbatim>

  If installation failed, then you should return <verbatim|NULL> and
  <verbatim|*errors> should contain an error message. Both <verbatim|what>
  and the returned string have a special format, in which it is possible to
  encode arbitrary <apply|TeXmacs> documents. This format will be explained
  in the next section.

  The routine <verbatim|evaluate> is used to evaluate the expression
  <verbatim|what> inside a <apply|TeXmacs>-session with name
  <verbatim|session>. It should return the evaluation of <verbatim|what> or
  <verbatim|NULL> if an error occurred. <verbatim|*errors> either contains
  one or more warning messages or an error message, if the evaluation failed.
  The command:\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ (package-format "yourcas" "input-format" "output-format")
  </verbatim>

  is used in order to specify the input and output formats for evaluations,
  in a similar way as in the case of pipes.

  The routine <verbatim|execute> has a similar specification as
  <verbatim|evaluate>, except that it is not used for the evaluation of
  expressions inside a <apply|TeXmacs>-session, but rather for other
  communication purposes between <apply|TeXmacs> and your package.

  <\remark>
    All strings returned by the routines <verbatim|install>,
    <verbatim|evaluate> and <verbatim|execute>, as well as all warning and
    error messages should be allocated using <verbatim|malloc>. They will be
    freed by <apply|TeXmacs> using <verbatim|free>.
  </remark>

  The first version of the <apply|TeXmacs> communication protocol also
  requires <apply|TeXmacs> to export an instance of the data structure:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ typedef struct TeXmacs_exports_1 {<format|next line>
    \ \ \ \ \ char* version_protocol; /* "TeXmacs communication protocol 1"
    */<format|next line> \ \ \ \ \ char* version_TeXmacs;<format|next line>
    \ \ \ } TeXmacs_exports_1;
  </verbatim>

  The string <verbatim|version_protocol> contains the version
  <verbatim|"TeXmacs communication protocol 1"> of the protocol and
  <verbatim|version_TeXmacs> the current version of <TeXmacs>.

  The standard ``fold'', ``unroll'' and ``switch'' tags implement the most
  frequent kinds of traversal of a slideshow. However, there are cases in
  which more complex successions are needed.

      </equation*>

      yields

    </compact>
  </cell>>>>>>
    <label|red-x-fig>Example of highlighting a variable <math|x> when
    switching from one slide to a next one.
  </big-figure>

  For instance, imagine that we are given a slide, and that we wish to
  highlight all occurrences of some variable <math|x> in red on the next
  slide (see figure<nbsp><reference|red-x-fig>). This could be achieved by
  using a switch tag: we just copy the whole slide both in the first and in
  the second branch of the switch, and next color all instances of <math|x>
  red in the second branch. However, this solution has the disadvantage that
  any <em|a posteriori> modification on the slide has to be made both in the
  first and in the second branch.

  <TeXmacs> provides a so called ``overlay'' mechanism for this kind of more
  complex successions of slides. You may insert a pile of overlays using
  <menu|Insert|Fold|Overlays|Standard>. At the start, the pile contains a
  unique overlay, but new overlays can then be added using the standard
  keyboard shortcuts <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)> and
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-left)> for <hlink|structured
  insertion|../editing/man-structured-editing.en.tm>. When applied to
  overlays, the standard keys <key|F10> and <key|F11> for traversing the
  presentation have the effect of going up and down in the pile of overlays.

  By default, all text which is typed by the user will be visible on all
  overlays. But, using the filters in the menu <menu|Insert|Fold|Overlay>, it
  is also possible to create text which is only visible on specified overlays
  of the pile. There are four basic types of filters:

  <\description>
    <item*|<subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Visible from here on>>Text that
    will be visible on this and all subsequent overlays.

    <item*|<subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Visible until here>>Text that
    will be visible on this and all previous overlays.

    <item*|<subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Visible only here>>Text that
    will be visible only on this overlay.

    <item*|<subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Visible except here>>Text that
    will be visible on all but the current overlays.
  </description>

  In a similar way, <TeXmacs> provides tags for alternate views: depending on
  whether a certain predicate is met, we show the ``main content'' on certain
  overlays and the ``alternate content'' on the remaining overlays. We use
  the same four types of predicates:

  <\description>
    <item*|<subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Alternate from here on>>The
    alternate text will be used on this and all subsequent overlays.

    <item*|<subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Alternate until here>>The
    alternate text will be used on this and all previous overlays.

    <item*|<subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Alternate only here>>The
    alternate text will only be used on this overlay.

    <item*|<subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Alternate except here>>The
    alternate text will be used on all but the current overlays.
  </description>

  <TeXmacs> finally provides a means of customizing the way that ``hidden''
  and ``shown'' content should be rendered: user determined coloring schemes
  can be used using the <markup|alter-colors> tag which can be inserted from
  <menu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Specify color alternation>. For instance, in
  order to achieve the effect mentioned in the example from
  Figure<nbsp><reference|red-x-fig>, you may specify a ``black to red'' color
  alternation, and then use a <subsubsubmenu|Insert|Fold|Overlay|Visible from
  here on> type of overlay.

  <tmdoc-title|Customization of the sectional tags>

  The <tmdtd|section-base> <abbr|d.t.d.> also contains many tags for
  customizing the rendering of sections and other section-related behaviour.
  The following two tags affect all sections:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|sectional-sep>>
    A macro for customizing the separator between the number of a section and
    its title. By default, we use two spaces.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|sectional-short-style>>
    A predicate which tells whether documents for this style are intended to
    be short or long. When <markup|sectional-short-style> evaluates to
    <verbatim|true>, then appendices, bibliographies, <abbr|etc.> are
    supposed to be special types of sections. Otherwise, they will be special
    types of chapters.
  </explain>

  For each sectional tag <markup|<em|x>>, the following tags are provided for
  customization:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|<em|x>-text>>
    A macro which displays the (localized) name of the sectional environment.
    For instance, <inactive*|<with|language|french|<appendix-text>>> produces
    ``<with|language|french|<appendix-text>>''.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|<em|x>-title|title>>
    A macro for displaying the unnumbered section title.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|<em|x>-numbered-title|title>>
    A macro for displaying the numbered section title.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|<em|x>-display-numbers>>
    A predicate which specifies whether numbers will really be displayed. For
    instance, in the case of <markup|paragraph>, this macro evaluates to
    false. Consequently, even though <markup|<em|x>-numbered-title> <em|does>
    display the paragraph number, the main macro <markup|<em|x>> will call
    <markup|<em|x>-title> and not <markup|<em|x>-numbered-title>, so that
    paragraph titles are not numbered.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|<em|x>-sep>>
    A macro for customizing the separator between the number of a section and
    its title. By default, we call <markup|sectional-sep>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|<em|x>-clean>>
    A hook for resetting all subcounters of the section.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|<em|x>-header|name>>
    A hook for changing the page headers.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|<em|x>-toc|name>>
    A hook for putting the section title into the table of contents.
  </explain>

  Finally, the <tmdtd|section-base> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides rendering macros
  <markup|render-table-of-contents>, <markup|render-bibliography>,
  <markup|render-index> and <markup|render-glossary>, each of which takes two
  arguments: the name of the section and its body. It also provides the
  macros <markup|prologue-text>, <markup|epilogue-text>,
  <markup|bibliography-text>, <markup|table-of-contents-text>,
  <markup|index-text>, <markup|glossary-text>, <markup|list-of-figures-text>
  and <markup|list-of-tables-text> for customizing the names of special
  sections.

  <tmdoc-title|Utilities for writing style files>

  The <tmdtd|std-utils> package provides several macros which may be useful
  when writing style files. First of all, the following macros may be used
  for rendering purposes:

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|hflush>

    <explain-macro|left-flush>

    <explain-macro|right-flush>
  <|explain>
    Low level tags for flushing to the right in the definition of
    environments. One usually should use <markup|wide-normal> or
    <markup|wide-centered> instead.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|wide-normal|body>

    <explain-macro|wide-centered|body>
  <|explain>
    These tags are used to make the <src-arg|body> span over the entire
    paragraph width. The text is left-aligned in the case of
    <markup|wide-normal> and centered in the case of <markup|wide-centered>.
    Making a body span over the entire paragraph width does not change the
    rendering on paper, but it facilitates the editing on the document.
    Indeed, on the one hand, the box which indicates that you are inside the
    environment will span over the entire paragraph width. On the other hand,
    when clicking sufficiently close to the text inside this box, it becomes
    easier to position your cursor at the start or at the end inside the
    environment. You may check this by clicking on one of the texts below:

    <with|color|red|\<gtr\>><wide-normal|Some text inside a
    <markup|wide-normal> environment.><with|color|red|\<less\>>

    <with|color|red|\<gtr\>><wide-centered|Some text inside a
    <markup|wide-centered> environment.><with|color|red|\<less\>>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|padded-normal|space-above|space-below|body>

    <explain-macro|padded-centered|space-above|space-below|body>
  <|explain>
    These tags are variants of <explain-macro|wide-normal|body> and
    <explain-macro|wide-centered|body>, which put some vertical white space
    <src-arg|space-above> and <src-arg|space-below> above and below the
    <src-arg|body>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|wide-bothlined|top-border|bot-border|top-sep|bot-sep|body>

    <explain-macro|wide-std-bothlined|body>

    <explain-macro|padded-bothlined|space-above|space-below|top-border|bot-border|top-sep|bot-sep|body>

    <explain-macro|padded-std-bothlined|space-above|space-below|body>

    <explain-macro|wide-underlined|bborder|bsep|body>

    <explain-macro|wide-std-underlined|body>
  <|explain>
    These tags are used to make the <src-arg|body> span over the entire
    paragraph width and to put a horizontal rule above and/or below it. The
    widths of the rules are given by <src-arg|top-border> and
    <src-arg|bot-border> and the separation between the rules by
    <src-arg|top-sep> and <src-arg|bot-sep>. The standard width and
    separation (used by <markup|wide-std-bothlined>,
    <markup|padded-std-bothlined> and <markup|wide-std-underlined>) are
    <verbatim|1ln> and <verbatim|1sep>. The padded variants specify
    additional spaces <src-arg|space-above> and <src-arg|space-below> above
    and below the rules. As an example, <inactive*|<wide-std-underlined|left<htab|5mm>right>>
    yields:

    <wide-std-underlined|left<htab|5mm>right>

    Wide underlined environments are typically used for page headers. Wide
    environments which are both overlined and underlined are typically used
    for abstracts or floating figures and tables.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|wide-framed|border-width|hsep|vsep|body>

    <explain-macro|wide-std-framed|body>

    <explain-macro|wide-framed-colored|border-color|body-color|border-width|hsep|vsep|body>

    <explain-macro|wide-std-framed-colored|border-color|body-color|body>
  <|explain>
    These tags put the <src-arg|body> inside a frame box which spans over the
    whole paragraph. The user may specify a <src-arg|border-width>,
    horizontal and vertical separations <src-arg|hsep> and <src-arg|vsep>
    between the border and the text, and colors <src-arg|border-color> and
    <src-arg|body-color> for the border and the background. For instance,
    <inactive*|<wide-std-framed-colored|brown|pastel green|Hi there!>> yields

    <wide-std-framed-colored|brown|pastel green|Hi there!>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|indent-left|left-amount|body>

    <explain-macro|indent-right|right-amount|body>

    <explain-macro|indent-both|left-amount|right-amount|body>
  <|explain>
    These environments may be used in order to increase the current left
    and/or right indentation by the amounts <src-arg|left-amount> and/or
    <src-arg|right-amount>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|margin-first-other|first-margin|other-margin|body>
  <|explain>
    This environment allows to set the margin <src-arg|first-margin> for the
    first lines of paragraphs in the <src-arg|body>, as well as the margin
    <src-arg|other-margin> for the other lines. This environment is for
    instance useful for glossaries, indexes, <abbr|etc.>, in which case
    <src-arg|other-margin> is often larger than <src-arg|first-margin>.
    Notice that this environment enables indentation for the first line of
    <src-arg|body>.
  </explain>

  <label|header-footer-helper>The following macros may be used in order to
  set headers and footers:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|set-header|header-text>>
    A macro for permanently changing the header. Notice that certain tags in
    the style file, like sectional tags, may override such manual changes.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|set-footer|footer-text>>
    A macro for permanently changing the footer. Again, certain tags in the
    style file may override such manual changes.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|blanc-page>>
    Remove all headers and footers from this page.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|simple-page>>
    Remove the header of this page and set the footer to the current page
    number (centered). This macro is often called for title pages or at the
    start of new chapters.
  </explain>

  Other macros provided by <tmdtd|std-utils> are:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|localize|text>>
    This macro should be used in order to ``localize'' some English text to
    the current language. For instance, <inactive*|<with|language|french|<localize|Theorem>>>
    yields <with|language|french|<localize|Theorem>>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|map|fun|tuple>>
    This macro applies the macro <src-arg|fun> to each of the entries in a
    <src-arg|tuple> (or the children of an arbitrary <TeXmacs> tag) and
    returns the result as a tuple. For instance,
    <inactive*|<map|<macro|x|<em|<arg|x>>>|<tuple|1|2|3>>> yields
    <map|<macro|x|<em|<arg|x>>>|<tuple|1|2|3>> (the quote only appears when
    rendering the result, not when performing further computations with it).

  In the <menu|Source tags> group of the <menu|Document|Source> menu, you find
  several ways to customize the rendering of source trees in your document.
  We recommend you to play around with the different possibilities in a
  document of your own (after enabling <menu|Document|Source|Source tree>) or a
  standard style package in <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/packages>.

  First of all, you may choose between the different major styles
  ``angular'', ``scheme'', ``functional'' and ``<LaTeX>'' \ for rendering
  source trees, as illustrated in the figure below:

  <\big-figure>
    <\quote-env>
      <small|<tabular*|<tformat|<twith|table-width|1par>|<twith|table-hmode|exact>|<cwith|2|2|1|1|cell-hyphen|t>|<cwith|2|2|3|3|cell-hyphen|t>|<cwith|5|5|1|1|cell-hyphen|t>|<cwith|5|5|3|3|cell-hyphen|t>|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-size|0.71|Angular>>|<cell|>|<cell|<with|font-size|0.71|Scheme>>>|<row|<\cell>

      </cell>>>>>>
    </quote-env>
  <|big-figure>

  </big-figure>

  Secondly, you may wish to reserve a special treatment to certain tags like
  <markup|concat> and <markup|document>. In the menu
  <menu|Document|Source|Special> you may specify to which extent you want to
  treat such tags in a special way:

  <\description>
    <item*|None>No tags receive a special treatment.

    <item*|Formatting>Only the formatting tags <markup|concat> and
    <markup|document> are represented as usual.

    <item*|Normal>In addition to the formatting tags, a few other tags like
    <markup|compound>, <markup|value> and <markup|arg> are represented in a
    special way.

    <item*|Maximal>At the moment, this option is not yet implemented. The
    intention is to allow the user to write his own customizations and to
    allow for special rendering of basic operations like <markup|plus>.
  </description>

  These different options are illustrated below:

  <\big-figure>
    <\quote-env>
      <small|<tabular*|<tformat|<twith|table-width|1par>|<twith|table-hmode|exact>|<cwith|2|2|1|1|cell-hyphen|t>|<cwith|2|2|3|3|cell-hyphen|t>|<cwith|5|5|1|1|cell-hyphen|t>|<cwith|5|5|3|3|cell-hyphen|t>|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-size|0.71|None>>|<cell|>|<cell|<with|font-size|0.71|Formatting>>>|<row|<\cell>

      </cell>>>>>>
    </quote-env>

  <|big-figure>
    Different ways to render special tags.
  </big-figure>

  Another thing which may be controlled by the user is whether the
  presentation of tags should be compact or stretched out across several
  lines. Several levels of compactification may be specified in the
  <menu|Document|Source|Compactification> menu:

  <\description>
    <item*|Minimal>The tags are all stretched out across several lines.

    <item*|Only inline tags>All non-inline tags are stretched out across
    several lines.

    <item*|Normal>All inline arguments at the start of the tag are
    represented in a compact way. As soon as we encounter a block argument,
    the remainder of the arguments are stretched out across several lines.

    <item*|Inline arguments>All inline arguments are represented in a compact
    way and only block tags are stretched out across several lines.

    <item*|Maximal>All source code is represented in a compact way.
  </description>

  The ``normal'' and ``inline arguments'' options rarely differ. The visual
  effect of the different options is illustrated below:

  Finally, the user may specify the way closing tags should be rendered when
  the tag is stretched out across several lines. The rendering may either be
  minimalistic, compact, long, or recall the matching opening tag. The
  different options are illustrated below:

  <tmdoc-title|Users, groups, and permissions>

  The additional layer <scm|db-users.scm> allows you to specify read, write
  and administration permissions for database entries. There are two main
  types of users of <TeXmacs> databases: individual users and groups. Groups
  may delegate permissions to individual users or other groups. In addition,
  there are two special users <scm|"root"> (or <scm|#t>) and
  <scm|"anonymous"> (or <scm|#f>).

  <tmdoc-title|Customizing the treatment of title information>

  <TeXmacs> uses the <markup|doc-data> tag in order to specify global data
  for the document. These data are treated in two stages by the
  <markup|doc-data> macro. <hlink|First|../../../main/styles/header/header-title-global.en.tm>,
  the document data are separated into several categories, according to
  whether the data should be rendered as a part of the main title or in
  footnotes or the abstract. <hlink|Secondly|../../../main/styles/header/header-title-customize.en.tm>,
  the data in each category are rendered using suitable macros.

  Each child of the <markup|doc-data> is a tag with some specific information
  about the document. Currently implemented tags are <markup|doc-title>,
  <markup|doc-subtitle>, <markup|doc-author>, <markup|doc-date>,
  <markup|doc-running-title>, <markup|doc-running-author>,
  <markup|doc-keywords>, <markup|doc-msc> and <markup|doc-note>. The
  <markup|doc-author> tag may occur several times. The <markup|author-data>
  tag is used in order to specify structured data for each of the authors of
  the document. Each child of the <markup|author-data> tag is a tag with
  information about the corresponding author. Currently implemented tags with
  author information are <markup|author-name>, <markup|author-affiliation>,
  <markup|author-email>, <markup|author-homepage> and <markup|author-note>.

  Most of the tags listed above also correspond to macros for rendering the
  corresponding information as part of the main title. For instance, if the
  date should appear in bold italic at a distance of at least <verbatim|1fn>
  from the other title fields, then you may redefine <markup|doc-date> as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <assign|doc-date|<macro|body|<style-with|src-compact|none|<vspace*|1fn><doc-title-block|<with|font-shape|italic|font-series|bold|<arg|body>>><vspace|1fn>>>>
    </inactive*>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <markup|title-block> macro is used in order to make the text span
  appropriately over the width of the title. The <markup|doc-title> and
  <markup|author-name> are special in the sense that they also render
  possible references to footnotes. For this reason, you should rather
  customize the <markup|doc-render-title> and <markup|author-render-name>
  macros in order to customize the rendering of the title and the name
  themselves.

  Notice also that the <markup|doc-running-title> and
  <markup|author-running-author> macros do not render anything, but rather
  call the <markup|header-title> and <markup|header-author> call-backs for
  setting the appropriate global page headers and footers. By default, the
  running title and author are extracted from the usual title and author
  names.

  In addition to the rendering macros which are present in the document, the
  main title (including author information, the date, <abbr|etc.>) is
  rendered using the <markup|doc-make-title> macro. The author information,
  as part of the main title, is rendered using <markup|render-doc-author> or
  <markup|render-doc-authors>, depending on whether the document has one or
  more authors. Footnotes to the title or to one of the authors are rendered
  using <markup|doc-title-note> <abbr|resp.> <markup|doc-author-note>. These
  footnote macros always expect a <markup|document> tag on input, because
  they may compress it into a horizontal concatenation.

  The first stage of processing the document data is more complex and the
  reader is invited to take a look at the <hlink|short
  descriptions|../../../main/styles/header/header-title-global.en.tm> of the
  macros which are involved in this process. It is also good to study the
  definitions of these macros in the <hlink|package
  itself|$TEXMACS_PATH/packages/header/title-base.ts>. In order to indicate
  the way things work, we finish with an example on how the email address and
  homepage of an author can be rendered in a footnote instead of the main
  title:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <assign|doc-author-main|<\macro|data>
        <\quasi>
          <unquote*|<select|<quote-arg|data>|author-name>>

          <unquote*|<select|<quote-arg|data>|author-affiliation>>
        </quasi>
      </macro>>

      <assign|doc-author-data-note|<xmacro|data|<\quasi>
        <unquote*|<select|<quote-arg|data>|author-email>>

        <unquote*|<select|<quote-arg|data>|author-homepage>>

        <unquote*|<select|<quote-arg|data>|author-note|document|<pat-any>>>
      </quasi>>>

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Basic data types>

  In this chapter, we give a rough description of <apply|TeXmacs>'s basic
  data types in <verbatim|Basic>. The description of the exported functions
  is non exhaustive and we refer to the corresponding header files for more
  precision.

  <section|Memory allocation and data structures in TeXmacs>

  The file <verbatim|fast_alloc.hpp> declares the <apply|TeXmacs> memory
  allocation routines. These routines are very fast for small sizes, since
  for each such size, <apply|TeXmacs> maintains a linked list of freed
  objects of that size. No garbage collection has been implemented yet.

  Modulo a few exceptions, all <apply|TeXmacs> composite data structures are
  based on the modules <verbatim|concrete>, <verbatim|abstract>,
  <verbatim|concrete_null> and <verbatim|abstract_null>. Consequently, these
  data structures are pointers to representation classes, which may be
  abstract in the case of <verbatim|abstract> and <verbatim|abstract_null>,
  and which always contain a reference counter. Because of the reference
  counter, the C++ copy operator is very fast. Most of the implemented data
  structures also export a function <verbatim|copy>, which should be used if
  one really wants to physically duplicate an object,

  For classes constructed using <verbatim|concrete_null> or
  <verbatim|abstract_null>, the pointer to the representation class is
  allowed to be <verbatim|NULL> and we have a default constructor which
  initializes this pointer with <verbatim|NULL>. Instances of these classes
  are tested to be <verbatim|NULL> using the function <verbatim|nil>.
  Examples of such classes are lists, files and widgets.

  <section|Array-like structures>

  <apply|TeXmacs> implements three ``array-like'' structures:

  <\itemize>
    <item><verbatim|string> is the string type, which may contain '0'
    characters.

    <item><verbatim|tree> is the tree type with string labels.

    <item><verbatim|array\<less\>T\<gtr\>> is the generic array type with
    elements of type <verbatim|T>.
  </itemize>

  Array-like structures export the following operations:

  <\itemize>
    <item><verbatim|N> computes the length of an array.

    <item><verbatim|[]> accesses an element.

    <item><verbatim|\<less\>\<less\>> is used for appending elements or
    arrays.
  </itemize>

  For trees <verbatim|t>, we notice that <verbatim|t-\<gtr\>label> yields the
  label of the tree and <verbatim|t-\<gtr\>a> the array of its children. The
  second argument of <verbatim|\<less\>\<less\>> for trees is either a tree
  or an array of trees.

  The implementation has been made such that the <verbatim|\<less\>\<less\>>
  operation is fast, which is useful when considering arrays as buffers.
  Actually, the allocated space for arrays with more than five elements
  (words for strings) is always a power of two, so that new elements can be
  appended quickly. Notice that GNU malloc also always allocates blocks,
  whose sizes are powers of two. Therefore, we do not waste memory for small
  and large arrays.

  <section|Lists>

  Generic lists are implemented by the class <verbatim|list\<less\>T\<gtr\>>.
  The ``nil'' list is created using <verbatim|list\<less\>T\<gtr\>()>, an
  atom using <verbatim|list\<less\>T\<gtr\>(T x)> and a general list using
  <verbatim|list\<less\>T\<gtr\>(T x, list\<less\>T\<gtr\> next)>. If
  <verbatim|l> is a list, <verbatim|l-\<gtr\>item> and
  <verbatim|l-\<gtr\>next> correspond to its label and its successor
  respectively (<verbatim|car> and <verbatim|cdr> in lisp). The functions
  <verbatim|nil> and <verbatim|atom> tests whether a list is nil or an atom.
  The function <verbatim|N> computes the length of a list.

  The type <verbatim|list\<less\>T\<gtr\>> is also denoted by
  <verbatim|path>, because some additional functions are defined for it.
  Indeed, paths are used for accessing descendents in tree like structures.
  For instance, we implemented the function <verbatim|tree subtree (tree t,
  path p)>.

  <section|Hash tables>

  The <verbatim|hashmap\<less\>T,U\<gtr\>> class implements hash tables with
  entries in <verbatim|T> and values in <verbatim|U>. A function
  <verbatim|hash> should be implemented for <verbatim|T>. Given a hash table
  <verbatim|H>. We set elements through\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ H(x)=y;
  </verbatim>

  and access to elements through\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ H[x]
  </verbatim>

  We also implemented a variant <verbatim|rel_hashmap\<less\>T,U\<gtr\>> of
  hash tables, which also have a list-like structure, which makes them useful
  for implementing recursive environments.

  <section|Other data structures>

  <\itemize>
    <item><verbatim|command> implements abstract commands.

    <item><verbatim|file> implements files.

    <item><verbatim|iterator\<less\>T\<gtr\>> implements generic iterators.

    <item><verbatim|rectangles> implements rectangles and lists of
    rectangles.

    <item><verbatim|space> implements stretchable spaces.

    <item><verbatim|timer> implements timers.
  </itemize>

  <tmdoc-title|Books and multifile documents>

  When a document gets really large, you may want to subdivide it into
  smaller pieces. This both makes the individual pieces more easily reusable
  in other works and it improves the editor's responsiveness. An entire file
  can be inserted into another one using <menu|Insert|Link|Include>. In order
  to speed up the treatment of included documents, they are being buffered.
  In order to update all included documents, you should use
  <menu|Tools|Update|Inclusions>.

  When writing a book, one usually puts the individual chapters in files
  <verbatim|c1.tm>, <verbatim|c2.tm> until <verbatim|cn.tm>. One next creates
  one file <verbatim|book.tm> for the whole book, in which the files
  <verbatim|c1.tm>, <verbatim|c2.tm> until <verbatim|cn.tm> are included
  using the above mechanism. The table of contents, bibliography, etc. are
  usually put into <verbatim|book.tm>.

  In order to see cross references to other chapters when editing a
  particular chapter <verbatim|ci.tm>, one may specify <verbatim|book.tm> as
  a ``master file'' for the files <verbatim|c1.tm> to <verbatim|cn.tm> using
  <menu|Tools|Project|Attach master...>. Currently, the chapter numbers
  themselves are not dealt with by this mechanism, so you may want to
  manually assign the environment variable <src-var|chapter-nr> at the start
  of each chapter file in order to get the numbering right when editing.

  <tmdoc-title|Conventions for the names of files>

  Most documentation should be organized as a function of the topic in a
  directory tree. The subdirectories of the top directory are the following:

  <\description>
    <item*|about>Various information about the <TeXmacs> system (authors,
    changes, <abbr|etc.>).

    <item*|devel>Documentation for developers.

    <item*|main>The main documentation.
  </description>

  Please try to keep the number of entries per directory reasonably small.

  File names in the main directory should be of the form
  <verbatim|type-name.language.tm>. In the other directories, they are of the
  form <verbatim|name.language.tm>. Here <verbatim|type> is a major
  indication for the type of documentation; it should be one of the
  following:

  <\description>
    <item*|man>For inclusion in the <TeXmacs> manual.

    <item*|tut>For inclusion in the <TeXmacs> tutorial.
  </description>

  You should try to keep the documentation on the same topic together,
  regardless of the type. Indeed, this allows you to find more easily all
  existing documentation on a particular topic. Also, it may happen that you
  want to include some documentation which was initially meant for the
  tutorial in the manual. The <verbatim|language> in which is the
  documentation has been written should be a two letter code like
  <verbatim|en>, <verbatim|fr>, etc. The main <verbatim|name> of your file
  should be the same for the translations in other languages. For instance,
  <verbatim|man-keyboard.en.tm> should not be translated as
  <verbatim|man-clavier.fr.tm>.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Specifying the cell and table alignment>

  The most frequent formatting operation is the horizontal or vertical
  alignment of a block of cells. You may use the
  <shortcut|(positioning-left)>,
  <shortcut|(positioning-right)>,
  <shortcut|(positioning-up)> and
  <shortcut|(positioning-down)> keystrokes to quickly align more to
  the left, right, top or bottom.

  A specific alignment can also be selected in the
  <apply|menu|Table|Horizontal cell alignment> and <apply|menu|Table|Vertical
  cell alignment> menus. Alternatively, you may use keyboard shorthands of
  the types <key|table h><render-key|<with|mode|math|x>> and <key|table v
 ><render-key|<with|mode|math|x>> for horizontal resp. vertical alignment.

  Similarly, you may specify how the table itself should be aligned with
  respect to the surrounding text. This is either done via the
  <apply|menu|Table|Horizontal table alignment> and
  <apply|menu|Table|Vertical table alignment> submenus, or using keyboard
  shorthands of the form <key|table H><render-key|<with|mode|math|x>> or
  <key|table V><render-key|<with|mode|math|x>>. Here <render-key|<with|mode|math|x>>
  represents <key|l> for ``left'', <key|c> for ``centered'', <key|r> for
  ``right'', <key|b> for ``bottom'' and <key|t> for ``top''.

  <tmdoc-title|Macro expansion>

  The main interest of the <TeXmacs>' style-sheet language is the possibility
  to define macros. These come in three flavours: ordinary macros, macros
  which take an arbitrary number of arguments and external macros, whose
  expansion is computed by <name|Scheme> or a plug-in. The macro-related
  primitives are available from the <menu|Source|Macro> menu. Below, we will
  only describe the ordinary macros. For more details, we refer to the
  section about <hyper-link|macro primitives|../../format/primitives/prim-macro.en.tm>.

  Ordinary macros are usually defined using

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|my-macro|<macro|<active*|x<rsub|1>>|<active*|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>>|<active*|x<rsub|n>>|body>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  After such an assignment, <markup|my-macro> becomes a new primitive with
  <with|mode|math|n> arguments, which may be called using

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive|<my-macro|<active*|y<rsub|1>>|<active*|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>>|<active*|y<rsub|n>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Inside the body of the macro, the <markup|arg> primitive may be used to
  retrieve the values of the arguments to the macro.

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hello|<macro|name|Hello <arg|name>, you look nice
    today!>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  It is possible to call a macro with less or more arguments than the
  expected number. Superfluous arguments are simply ignored. Missing
  arguments take the nullary <markup|uninit> primitive as value:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hey|<macro|first|second|<style-with|src-compact|none|<if|<equal|<arg|second>|<uninit>>|Hey
    <arg|first>, you look lonely today...|Hey <arg|first> and <arg|second>,
    you form a nice couple!>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  We finally notice that you are allowed to compute with macros, in a similar
  way as in functional programming, except that our macros are not closures
  (yet). For instance:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive|<assign|my-macro-copy|<inactive|<value|my-macro>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <markup|compound> tag may be used to apply macros which are the result
  of a computation:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|overloaded-hi|<macro|name|<style-with|src-compact|none|<compound|<if|<nice-weather>|<value|happy-hi>|<value|sad-hi>>|<arg|name>>>>>>

  In order to guarantee the origin of releases, these must be signed with a
  <name|DSA> key, whose public part will be bundled with the application. On
  the server side a so-called <with|font-shape|italic|appcast> must be
  updated for each release. It is an <name|xml> file containing information
  about available downloads, their contents and their digital signatures,
  following the specification for <name|Sparkle>/<name|WinSparkle>. For the
  moment we refer to <name|Sparkle>'s documentation for more details.

  In principle it should be easy for anyone to release their custom versions
  of <TeXmacs> and let their users autoupdate them with a simple change in
  the config files. For this they only need provide the public key and the
  <name|url> of the appcast.

  <subsection|Operating system specifics>

  Under <name|MacOS> the process of creation of the appcast is partially
  automated through the <name|make> build rule <tt|MACOS_RELEASE>. Calling
  <tt|make MACOS_RELEASE> will compile and bundle <TeXmacs>, then zip and
  finally digitally sign the resulting <tt|TeXmacs-*.app.zip> with the script
  <tt|admin/misc/sign_update>. In order for this to work, one has to set the
  environment variable <tt|TEXMACS_PRIVATE_DSA> to point to the location of
  the private <name|DSA> key used to sign releases. At the end of the build
  process a chunk of <name|XML> is printed that can be pasted in the
  <tt|appcast.xml> file.

  Under <name|Windows> digital signatures are not yet supported by
  <name|WinSparkle> and as such will be ignored (Aug. 2013).

  There is no support for automatic notification of releases under
  <name|Linux> yet. Automatic download and installation is unlikely to happen
  due to the way packaging systems work for most distributions.

  <subsection|Client side interface>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(check-updates-background)><explain-synopsis|check for updates in
    the background>
  <|explain>
    Start a background check for updates. A dialog box pops up only if
    there's an update. Configuration variables must be properly set for this
    call to work. In particular, the appcast url must be set via the
    preference <scm|"updater:appcast">.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(check-updates-foreground)><explain-synopsis|check for updates in
    the foreground>
  <|explain>
    Start a check for updates immediately popping up a dialog with the
    progress. This call is non-blocking at least with <name|Sparkle> and
    <name|WinSparkle> since they run in separate threads.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(check-updates-interval <scm-arg|integer>)><explain-synopsis|sets
    the update interval>
  <|explain>
    Sets the interval in hours to wait between automatic checks if these are
    activated via <scm|"updater:automatic-checks">. Note that this
    <with|font-series|bold|does not> alter the value of the preference
    <scm|"updater:interval">, whose use is preferred.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(check-updates-interval <scm-arg|boolean>)><explain-synopsis|sets
    the update interval>
  <|explain>
    Tells <TeXmacs> whether to automatically check for updates. Note that
    this <with|font-series|bold|does not> alter the value of the preference
    <scm|"updater:automatic-checks">, whose use is preferred.
  </explain>

  The following preferences determine the behaviour of the automatic update
  system:

  <\explain>
    <scm|("updater:appcast" <scm-arg|url>)><explain-synopsis|preference>
  <|explain>
    The <name|url> to the appcast which will be used by the startup check. An
    empty or undefined value will deactivate both automatic and manual
    checks.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|("updater:automatic-checks" <scm-arg|boolean>)><explain-synopsis|preference>
  <|explain>
    Whether <TeXmacs> should automatically look for updates in the background
    (some time) after startup. Use <scm|"updater:check-interval"> to set the
    number of hours to wait between checks.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|("updater:check-interval" <scm-arg|integer>)><explain-synopsis|preference>
  <|explain>
    How often should <TeXmacs> look for updates? The interval is given in
    hours, with a minimum of one. Setting this to zero deactivates automatic
    checks by setting <scm|"updater:automatic-checks"> to false.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|("updater:public-dsa-key" <scm-arg|url>)><explain-synopsis|preference>
  <|explain>
    The file with the public <name|DSA> key to use to verify the digital
    signature of releases. This feature is currently (Aug. 2013) only
    supported under <name|MacOS>, but the preference value is ignored:
    <name|Sparkle> will use the value set in the <tt|SUPublicDSAKeyFile> key
    in the application bundle's <tt|Info.plist> dictionary.

  <tmdoc-title|Built-in environment variables>

  The way <TeXmacs> <hyper-link|typesets|../basics/typesetting.en.tm>
  documents is influenced by so called <em|environment variables>. The
  <hyper-link|style-sheet language|../stylesheet/stylesheet.en.tm> uses a so
  called <em|environment> (or context) to store both environment variables
  and <hyper-link|macros|../stylesheet/prim-macro.en.tm>. The environment
  variables are subdivided into two catagories: built-in variables and
  additional variables provided by style files. Built-in variables usually
  affect the layout, while additional variables mostly serve computational
  purposes. In the next sections of this chapter, we will describe all
  built-in environment variables.

  A typical built-in environment variable is <src-var|color>. The value of an
  environment variable may be <hyper-link|changed|../stylesheet/prim-env.en.tm>
  permanently using <markup|assign> and temporarily using the <markup|with>
  primitive:

  <\tm-fragment>
    Some <with|color|dark red|colored> text.
  </tm-fragment>

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|Some <with|color|dark red|colored> text.>
  </tm-fragment>

  Counters are typical environment variables defined in style-sheets.

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\enumerate>
      <item>A weirdly

      <assign|item-nr|3><item>numbered list...
    </enumerate>
  </tm-fragment>

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<\enumerate>
      <item>A weirdly

      <assign|item-nr|3><item>numbered list...
    </enumerate>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The typesetting language uses <def-index|dynamic scoping> of variables.
  That means that macros can access and modify variables in their calling
  context. In the previous example, the <markup|enumerate> macro locally
  initializes <src-var|item-nr> to <with|mode|math|0> (uses <markup|with>)
  and the <markup|item> macro increments it by one and shows its value. Since
  <markup|enumerate> locally redefines <src-var|item-nr>, the original value
  of <src-var|item-nr> is restored on exit.

  Each document comes with an <hyper-link|initial
  environment|../basics/tm-docs.en.tm#init-env> with the initial values of
  environment values, <abbr|i.e.> their values just before we typeset the
  document. If an environment variable does not occur in the initial
  environment, then its initial value defaults to its value after typesetting
  the document style and possible additional packages. The initial
  environment before typesetting the style files and packages is built-in
  into the editor.

  Some variables, like header and footer variables, must be set inside the
  document, their initial environment value is ignored. Generally, they
  should be set by header and sectioning markup.

  <tmdoc-title|Limitations of the current <LaTeX> converters>

  <paragraph*|Limitations of the <TeXmacs> to <LaTeX> converter>

  Some of the <TeXmacs> primitives have no analogues in <LaTeX>. When
  converting such primitives from <TeXmacs> into <LaTeX>, they will usually
  be either ignored or replaced by an approximative translation. A (probably
  incomplete) list of <TeXmacs> features with no <LaTeX> counterparts is as
  follows:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Left primes.

    <item>Big separators between big parentheses.

    <item>Trees.

    <item>Certain features of tables (background color, cell span, vertical
    alignment, <abbr|etc.>).

    <item>Complex user macros.

    <item>Vertical spaces ``before'' and ``after''.

    <item>Indentation flags ``before'' and ``after''.

    <item>Most types of interactive content: hyperlinks, actions, sessions,
    tags for the presentation mode, animations and sounds, etc.
  </itemize>

  In addition, several issues are only partially implemented:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Non standard fonts.

    <item>Certain table properties

    <item>Style parameters.
  </itemize>

  Of course, there are also differences between the typesetting algorithms
  used by <TeXmacs> and <TeX>/<LaTeX>, so the <TeXmacs> to <LaTeX> is not
  intended to be <em|wysiwyg>.

  <paragraph*|Limitations of the <LaTeX> to <TeXmacs> converter>

  As explained in the introduction, the conversion of <LaTeX> documents into
  <TeXmacs> is more problematic than conversions the other way around. Only a
  subset of <LaTeX> can be converted to <TeXmacs> in a fully reliable way.
  This subset comprises virtually all common constructs, including macro
  definitions and the additional macros uses by the <TeXmacs> to <LaTeX>
  converter. However, the converter has no knowledge about style parameters.
  In particular, it cannot be used for the conversion of <LaTeX> style files.

  <tmdoc-title|Counters and counter groups>

  In <TeXmacs>, all automatic numbering of theorems, sections, <abbr|etc.> is
  done using ``counters''. Such counters may be individual counters (like
  <src-var|equation-nr>) or belong to a group of similar counters (like in
  the case of <src-var|theorem-nr>). <TeXmacs> allows for the customization
  of counters on an individual or groupwise basis. Typically, you may
  redefine the rendering of a counter (and let it appear as roman numerals,
  for instance), or undertake special action when increasing the counter
  (such as resetting a subcounter).

  New individual counters are defined using the following meta-macro:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-counter|x>>
    Defines a new counter with name <src-arg|x>. The counter is stored in the
    numerical environment variable <no-break><src-var|x-nr> and in addition,
    the following macros are defined:

    <\explain|<explain-macro|the-<em|x>>>
      Retrieve the counter such as it should be displayed on the screen.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|reset-<em|x>>>
      Reset the counter to <math|0>.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|inc-<em|x>>>
      Increase the counter. This macro may also be customized by the user so
      as to reset other counters (even though this is not the way things are
      done in the standard style files).
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|next-<em|x>>>
      Increase the counter, display the counter and set the current label.
    </explain>

    For the purpose of customization, the <markup|new-counter> macro also
    defines the following macros:

    <\explain|<explain-macro|display-<em|x>|nr>>
      This is the macro which is used for transforming the numerical value of
      the counter into the value which is displayed on the screen.
    </explain>

    <\explain|<explain-macro|counter-<em|x>|x>>
      This internal macro is used in order to retrieve the name of the
      environment variable which contains the counter. By default, this macro
      returns ``nr-x'', but it may be redefined if the counter belongs to a
      group.
    </explain>
  </explain>

  As noticed in the introduction, <TeXmacs> uses <em|counter groups> in order
  to make it possible to treat similar counters in a uniform way. For
  instance the counter group <verbatim|theorem-env> regroups the counters
  <verbatim|theorem>, <verbatim|proposition>, <verbatim|lemma>, <abbr|etc.>
  New counter groups are defined using:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-counter-group|g>>
    Create a new counter group with name <src-arg|g>. This results in the
    creation of the following macros:

    <\explain>
      <explain-macro|display-in-<em|g>|x|nr>

      <explain-macro|counter-in-<em|g>|x>
    <|explain>
      These macros are similar to the macros <markup|display-<em|x>> and
      <markup|counter-<em|x>> from above, but relative to the counter group.
      The name <src-arg|x> of the counter in consideration is passed as an
      argument.
    </explain>
  </explain>

  New counters can be added to the group using:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|add-to-counter-group|x|g>>
    Defines a new counter <src-arg|x> and add it to the counter group
    <src-arg|g>. For counters in groups, the macros <markup|display-<em|x>>
    and <markup|counter-<em|x>> are replaced with the corresponding macros
    <markup|display-in-<em|g>> and <markup|counter-<no-break>in-<no-break><em|g>>
    for their groups. Nevertheless, two new macros
    <markup|ind-display-<em|x>> and <markup|ind-counter-<em|x>> are defined
    which may take over the roles of <markup|display-<em|x>> and
    <markup|counter-<em|x>> in the case when the group consists of individual
    counters.
  </explain>

  At any moment, you may decide whether the counters of a group share a
  common group counter, or whether they all use their individual counters.
  This feature is used for instance in order to switch between American style
  numbering and European style numbering:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|group-common-counter|g>>
    Use a common counter for the group (which is stored in the environment
    variable <src-var|g-nr>).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|group-individual-counters|g>>
    Use an individual counter for each member of the group (this is the
    default).
  </explain>

  We notice that group counters may recursively belong to super-groups. For
  instance, the following declarations are from <verbatim|env-base.ts>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <new-counter-group|std-env>
    </inactive*>

    <inactive*|<new-counter-group|theorem-env>>

    <inactive*|<add-to-counter-group|theorem-env|std-env>>

    <inactive*|<group-common-counter|theorem-env>>
  </tm-fragment>

  <tmdoc-title|Formatting primitives>

  This section contains some important notes on formatting primitives which
  are not really part of the style-sheet language, but nevertheless very
  related.

  First of all, most <TeXmacs> presentation tags can be divided in two main
  categories: inline tags and block tags. For instance, <markup|frac> is a
  typical inline tag, whereas <markup|theorem> is a typical block tag. Some
  tags, like <markup|strong> are inline if their argument is and block in the
  contrary case. When writing macros, it is important to be aware of the
  inline or block nature of tags, because block tags inside a horizontal
  concatenation are not rendered in an adequate way. If you need to surround
  a block tag with some inline text, then you need the surround primitive:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|my-theorem|<macro|body|<surround|<no-indent><with|font-series|bold|Theorem.
    >|<right-flush>|<arg|body>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  In this example, we surrounded the body of the theorem with the bold text
  ``Theorem.'' at the left hand side and a ``right-flush'' at the right-hand
  side. Flushing to the right is important in order to make the blue visual
  border hints look nice when you are inside the environment.

  In most cases, <TeXmacs> does a good job in determining which tags are
  inline and which ones are not. However, you sometimes may wish to force a
  tag to be a block environment. For instance, the tag
  <markup|very-important> defined by

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|very-important|<macro|body|<with|font-series|bold|color|red|<arg|body>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  may both be used as an inline tag and a block environment. When placing
  your cursor just before the <markup|with>-tag and hitting
  <shortcut|(kbd-return)> followed by <key|backspace>, you obtain

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|very-important|<\macro|body>
      <with|font-series|bold|color|red|<arg|body>>
    </macro>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Since the body of the macro is now a block, your tag
  <markup|very-important> will automatically become a block environment too.
  In the future, the <markup|drd-props> primitive will give you even more
  control over which tags and arguments are inline and which ones are block.

  Another important property of tags is whether they contain normal textual
  content or tabular content. For instance, consider the definition of the
  standard <markup|eqnarray*> tag (with a bit of presentation markup
  suppressed):

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|eqnarray*|<macro|body|<with|par-mode|center|mode|math|math-display|true|par-sep|0.45fn|<surround|<no-page-break*><vspace*|0.5fn>|<vspace|0.5fn><no-indent*>|<tformat|<twith|table-hyphen|y>|<twith|table-width|1par>|<twith|table-min-cols|3>|<twith|table-max-cols|3>|<cwith|1|-1|1|1|cell-hpart|1>|<cwith|1|-1|-1|-1|cell-hpart|1>|<arg|body>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The use of <markup|surround> indicates that <markup|eqnarray*> is a block
  environment and the use of <markup|tformat> specifies that it is also a
  tabular environment. Moreover, the <markup|twith> and <markup|cwith> are
  used to specify further formatting information: since we are a block
  environment, we enable hyphenation and let the table span over the whole
  paragraph (unused space being equally distributed over the first and last
  columns). Furthermore, we have specified that the table contains exactly
  three columns.

  Finally, it is important to bear in mind that style-sheets do not merely
  specify the final presentation of a document, but that they may also
  contain information for the authoring phase. Above, we have already
  mentioned the use of the <markup|right-flush> tag in order to improve the
  rendering of \ visual border hints. Similarly, visual hints on invisible
  arguments may be given in the form of flags:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|labeled-theorem|<macro|id|body|<style-with|src-compact|none|<surround|<style-with|src-compact|none|<no-indent><flag|Id:
    <arg|id>|blue|id><with|font-series|bold|Theorem.
    >>|<right-flush>|<arg|body>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  More generally, the <markup|specific> tag with first argument ``screen''
  may be used to display visual hints, which are removed when printing the
  document.

  <tmdoc-title|The URL system>

  There is currently no comprehensive documentation for the url system. In
  the meantime, we'll collect here documentation for procedures related to
  it.

  <subsection|Navigation>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(go-to-url <scm-arg|u> . <scm-arg|opt-from>)><explain-synopsis|Jump
    to the url @u>
  <|explain>
    Opens a new buffer with the contents of the resource at <scm-arg|u>. This
    can be either a full <abbr|URL> or a file path, absolute or relative to
    the current <scm|buffer-master>. Both types of argument accept
    parameters. The second, optional argument, is an optional path for the
    cursor history.

    You can pass paramenters in <scm-arg|u> in two ways: appending a hash
    <tt|#> and some text, like in <tt|some/path/some-file.tm#blah> will open
    the file and jump to the first label of name <tt|blah> found, if any. The
    other possibility is the usual way in the web: append a question mark
    <tt|?> followed by pairs <tt|parameter=value>. Currently the parameters
    <tt|line>, <tt|column> and <tt|select>, which respectively jump to the
    chosen location and select the given text at that line, are supported by
    default for any file of format <scm|generic-file>. (see
    <scm|define-format>).

  <tmdoc-title|White space primitives>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|vspace|len>

    <explain-macro|vspace|len|min|max><explain-synopsis|vertical space after>
  <|explain>
    This primitive inserts an elastic vertical space after the current
    paragraph. All operands must be <hyper-link|length
    values|../language/lengths.en.tm>. The <src-arg|len> argument specifies
    the default length and the <src-arg|min> and <src-arg|max> arguments the
    bounds to vertical stretching for page breaking and filling. If
    <src-arg|min> and <src-arg|max> are not specified, then they are
    determined implicitly from the length unit of <src-arg|len>.

    Notice that operands are not evaluated, so they must be literal strings.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|vspace*|len>

    <explain-macro|vspace*|len|min|max><explain-synopsis|vertical space
    before>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is similar to <markup|vspace>, except that the vertical
    space is inserted <em|before> the current paragraph. The actual vertical
    space between two consecutive paragraphs is the <em|maximum>, not the
    sum, of the vertical spaces specified by the the <markup|vspace> and
    <markup|vspace*> tags in the surrounding paragraphs.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|space|len>

    <explain-macro|space|len|bot|top><explain-synopsis|rigid horizontal
    space>
  <|explain>
    This primitive inserts an empty box whose width is <src-arg|len>, and
    whose bottom and top sides are at distances <src-arg|bot> and
    <src-arg|top> from the baseline.

    If <src-arg|bot> and <src-arg|top> are not specified, then an empty box
    is inserted whose bottom is on the baseline and whose height is the same
    as the lowercase letter <samp|x> in the current font.

    Notice that operands are not evaluated, so they must be literal strings.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|hspace|len>

    <explain-macro|hspace|len|min|max><explain-synopsis|stretchable
    horizontal space>
  <|explain>
    This primitive inserts a stretchable horizontal space of nominal
    width <src-arg|len>, which must be a <hyper-link|length
    value|../language/lengths.en.tm>. The <src-arg|min> and <src-arg|max>
    arguments specify bounds to horizontal stretching for line breaking and
    filling. If <src-arg|min> and <src-arg|max> are not specified, then they
    are determined implicitly from the length unit of <src-arg|len>.

    Notice that operands are not evaluated, so they must be literal strings.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|htab|min>

    <explain-macro|htab|min|weight><explain-synopsis|horizontal spring>
  <|explain>
    Springs are horizontal spaces which extend so the containing paragraph
    takes all the available horizontal space. When a paragraph is line
    wrapped, split in several visual lines, only springs in the last line are
    extended.

    A spring has a <em|minimal width> and a <em|weight>. If the weight is 0,
    the spring is <em|weak>, otherwise it is <em|strong>. If a line contains
    mixed weak and strong springs, only the strong springs extend.\ 

    The fraction of the available horizontal space taken up by each strong
    spring is proportional to its weight. If there are only weak springs,
    they share the available space evenly.

    <\indent>
      <explain-macro|htab|min> inserts a strong spring of minimal width
      <src-arg|min> and of weight unity. The <src-arg|min> operand must be a
      <hyper-link|length value|../language/lengths.en.tm>.

      <explain-macro|htab|min|weight> specifies the weight, which can be a
      positive decimal number or one of the two special values documented
      below.

      <explain-macro|htab|min|<src-value|first>> inserts a <em|tail weak>
      spring, only the first one in a paragraph is significant.

      <explain-macro|htab|min|<src-value|last>> inserts a <em|head weak>
      spring, only the last one in a paragraph is significant.
    </indent>

    Operands are not evaluated and must be literal strings.

    Weak springs are useful in style-sheets. For example, tail weak springs
    are used to make the list environment extend to across the full
    paragraph, so vertical motion commands in nested lists behave as
    expected. In regular documents, springs are often used to place some text
    on the right side of the page and some other text on the left side.

    <item>Non standard fonts.

    <item>Style parameters.

  Any suggestion about desirable extensions of the conversion algorithm
  should be reported to\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ contact@texmacs.org

  and we will try to incorporate it as quickly as possible. It may take some
  time to implement the correct conversion of style parameters, since these
  are not the same in <TeXmacs> and <LaTeX>. Furthermore, layout differences
  between <TeXmacs> and <LaTeX> can not entirely be eliminated.

  <tmdoc-title|Specifying the current font>

  In this section, we describe the environment variables which control the
  rendering of fonts. Font properties may be controlled globally for the
  whole document in <menu|Document|Font> and locally for document fragments
  in <menu|Format|Font>.

  From an abstract point of view, a <em|font> is defined to be a graphically
  consistent way of rendering strings. Fonts are usually made up from glyphs
  like ``x'', ``ffi'', ``<math|\<alpha\>>'', ``<math|<op|<big|sum>>>'',
  <abbr|etc.> When rendering a string, the string is decomposed into glyphs
  so as to take into account ligatures (like fi, fl, ff, ffi, ffl). Next, the
  individual glyphs are positioned while taking into account kerning
  information (in ``xo'' the ``o'' character is slightly shifted to the left
  so as to take profit out of the hole in the ``x''). In the case of
  mathematical fonts, <TeXmacs> also provides a coherent rendering for
  resizable characters, like the large brackets in

  <\equation*>
    <around*|(|<around*|(|<around*|(||)><rsup|<rsup|\<nosymbol\>>>|)><rsup|<rsup|<rsup|\<nosymbol\>>>>|)>.
  </equation*>

  Similarly, a <em|font family> is a family of fonts with different
  characteristics (like font weight, slant, <abbr|etc.>), but with a globally
  consistent rendering. One also says that the fonts in a font family ``mix
  well together''. For instance, the standard computer modern roman font and
  its <with|font-series|bold|bold> and <with|font-shape|italic|italic>
  variants mix well together, but the computer modern roman font and the
  <with|font|avant-garde|Avant Garde> font do not.

  <\remark>
    In versions of <TeXmacs> prior to 1.99.1, the fonts for the mathematical
    and programming modes could be controlled independently using the
    environment variables <src-var|math-font>, <src-var|math-font-family>,
    <src-var|math-font-series>, <src-var|math-font-shape>,
    <src-var|prog-font>, <src-var|prog-font-family>,
    <src-var|prog-font-series>, <src-var|prog-font-shape>. In more recent
    versions of <TeXmacs>, the environment variables <src-var|font>,
    <src-var|font-family>, <src-var|font-series> and <src-var|font-shape>
    directly control the font for all modes.
  </remark>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|font|roman><explain-synopsis|font name>
  <|explain>
    These variables control the main name of the font, also called the
    <em|font family>. For instance:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|font|roman|Computer modern roman>, <with|font|pandora|Pandora>,
      <with|font|chancery|Chancery>, <with|font|palatino|Palatino>
    </tm-fragment>

    Similarly, <TeXmacs> supports various mathematical fonts:

    <\tm-fragment>
      Roman: <math|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>>

      Adobe: <math|<with|math-font|adobe|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>>>

      New roman: <math|<with|math-font|ENR|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>>>

      Concrete: <math|<with|math-font|concrete|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    Most fonts only implement a subset of all Unicode glyphs. Sometimes, the
    user might wish to combine several fonts to cover a larger subset. For
    instance, when specifying <verbatim|roman,IPAMincho> or
    <verbatim|cjk=IPAMincho,roman> as the <src-var|font> name, ordinary text
    and mathematics will be typeset using the default <verbatim|roman> font,
    whereas Chinese text will use the <verbatim|IPAMincho> font. Similarly,
    when specifying <verbatim|math=Stix,roman> as the <src-var|font> name,
    ordinary text will be typeset using the default <verbatim|roman> font,
    but mathematical formulas using the <verbatim|Stix> font.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|font-family|rm><explain-synopsis|font variant>
  <|explain>
    This variable selects a variant of the major font, like a sans serif
    font, a typewriter font, and so on. As explained above, variants of a
    given font are designed to mix well together. Physically speaking, many
    fonts do not come with all possible variants (sans serif, typewriter,
    <abbr|etc.>), in which case <TeXmacs> tries to fall back on a suitable
    alternative font.

    Typical variants for text fonts are <verbatim|rm> (roman), <verbatim|tt>
    (typewriter) and <verbatim|ss> (sans serif):

    <\tm-fragment>
      roman, <with|font-family|tt|typewriter> and <with|font-family|ss|sans
      serif>

      Sans serif formula: <with|font-family|ss|<math|sin
      <around*|(|x+y|)>=sin x*cos y+cos x*sin y>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|font-series|medium><explain-synopsis|font weight>
  <|explain>
    The font series determines the weight of the font. Most fonts only
    provide <verbatim|regular> and <verbatim|bold> font weights. Some fonts
    also provide <verbatim|light> as a possible value.

    <\tm-fragment>
      medium, <with|font-series|bold|bold>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|font-shape|right><explain-synopsis|font shape>
  <|explain>
    The font shape determines other characters of a font, like its slant,
    whether we use small capitals, whether it is condensed, and so on. For
    instance,

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|font-shape|right|upright>, <with|font-shape|slanted|slanted>,
      <with|font-shape|italic|italic>, <with|font-shape|left-slanted|left
      slanted>, <with|font-shape|small-caps|Small Capitals>,
      <with|font-shape|proportional|<with|font-family|tt|proportional
      typewriter>>, <with|font-shape|condensed|<with|font-series|bold|bold
      condensed>>, <with|font-shape|flat|<with|font-family|ss|flat sans
      serif>>, <with|font-shape|long|long>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <label|font-base-size><var-val|font-base-size|10><explain-synopsis|font
    base size>
  <|explain>
    The base font size is specified in <hlink|<verbatim|pt>
    units|../basics/lengths.en.tm> and is usually invariant throughout the
    document. Usually, the base font size is <verbatim|9pt>, <verbatim|10pt>,
    <verbatim|11pt> or <verbatim|12pt>. Other font sizes are usually obtained
    by changing the <hlink|<src-var|magnification>|env-general.en.tm#magnification>
    or the relative <hlink|font-size|#font-size>.

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|font-base-size|9|9pt>, <with|font-base-size|10|10pt>,
      <with|font-base-size|11|11pt>, <with|font-base-size|12|12pt>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <label|font-size><var-val|font-size|1><explain-synopsis|font size>
  <|explain>
    The real font size is obtained by multiplying the
    <src-var|font-base-size> by the <src-var|font-size> multiplier. The
    following standard font sizes are available from <menu|Format|Size>:

    <big-table|<descriptive-table|<tformat|<cwith|4|5|1|4|cell-bsep|0.25fn>|<cwith|4|5|1|4|cell-tsep|0.25fn>|<table|<row|<cell|size>|<cell|multiplier>|<cell|size>|<cell|multiplier>>|<row|<cell|<with|font-size|0.59|Tiny>>|<cell|0.59>|<cell|<with|font-size|0.71|Very

    huge>>|<cell|2>>>>>|Standard font sizes.>

    From a mathematical point of view, the multipliers are in a geometric
    progression with factor <no-break><math|<sqrt|2|4>>. Notice that the font
    size is also affected by the <hlink|index
    level|env-math.en.tm#math-level>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|dpi|600><explain-synopsis|fonts rendering quality>
  <|explain>
    The rendering quality of raster fonts (also called Type 3 fonts), such as
    the fonts generated by the <name|Metafont> program is controlled through
    its discretization precision in dots per inch. Nowadays, most laser
    printers offer a printing quality of at least <verbatim|600dpi>, which is
    also the default <src-var|dpi> setting for <TeXmacs>. For really high
    quality printing, professionals usually use a precision of
    <verbatim|1200dpi>. The <src-var|dpi> is usually set once and for all for
    the whole document.

  <tmdoc-title|The module system and lazy definitions>

  As explained above, each <scheme> file inside <TeXmacs> or one of its
  plug-ins corresponds to a <em|<TeXmacs> module>. The individual <TeXmacs>
  modules are usually grouped together into an internal or external module,
  which corresponds to a directory on your hard disk.

  Any <TeXmacs> module should start with an instruction of the form

  <\scm-code>
    (texmacs-module <em|name>

    \ \ (:use <em|submodule-1> ... <em|submodule-n>))
  </scm-code>

  The <verbatim|<em|name>> of the module is a list which corresponds to the
  location of the corresponding file. More precisely, <TeXmacs> searches for
  its modules in the path <verbatim|$GUILE_LOAD_PATH>, which defaults to the
  standard <name|Guile> load path, combined with
  <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs> and all <verbatim|progs> subdirectories in
  the plug-ins. For instance, the module <verbatim|(math math-edit)>
  corresponds to the file

  <verbatim| \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/edit/math-edit.scm>

  The user should explicitly specify all submodules on which the module
  depends, except those modules which are loaded by default, <abbr|i.e.> all
  language extensions and utilities in the directories

  <verbatim| \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/kernel<new-line>
  \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/utils/library>

  All symbols which are defined inside the module using <scm|define> or
  <scm|define-macro> are only visible within the module itself. In order to
  make the symbol publicly visible you should use <scm|tm-define> or
  <scm|tm-define-macro>. Currently, because of implementation details for the
  <hlink|contextual overloading system|overview-overloading.en.tm>, as soon
  as a symbol is declared to be public, it becomes visible inside all other
  modules. However, you should not rely on this: in the future, explicit
  importation with <scm|:use> might become<nbsp>necessary.

  Because the number of <TeXmacs> modules and plug-ins keeps on growing, it
  is inefficient to load all modules when booting. Instead, initialization
  files are assumed to declare the provided functionality in a <em|lazy> way:
  whenever the functionality is explictly needed, <TeXmacs> is triggered to
  load the corresponding modules (if this was not already done). In addition,
  <TeXmacs> may load some of these modules during spare time, when the
  computer is waiting for user input. Indeed, this helps increasing the
  reactivity of <TeXmacs> at the first use of the functionality.

  For instance, assume that you defined a large new editing function
  <scm|foo-action> inside the module <scm|(foo-edit)>. Then your
  initialization file <verbatim|init-foo.scm> would typically contain a line

  <\scm-code>
    (lazy-define (foo-edit) foo-action)
  </scm-code>

  Similarly, lazy keyboard shortcuts and menus for <verbatim|foo> might be
  defined using

  <\scm-code>
    (lazy-keyboard (foo-kbd) in-foo-mode?)

    (lazy-menu (foo-menu) foo-menu)
  </scm-code>

  For more concrete examples, we recommend the user to take a look at the
  standard initialization file <hlink|<verbatim|init-texmacs.scm>|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/init-texmacs.scm>.

  <label|redefinitions>On the negative side, the mechanism for lazy loading
  has the important consequence that you can no longer make assumptions on
  when a particular module is loaded. For instance, when you attempt to
  redefine a keyboard shortcut in your personal initialization file, it may
  happen that the standard definition is loaded after your \Predefinition\Q.
  In that case, your redefinition remains without consequence.

  For this reason, <TeXmacs> also provides the instruction <scm|import-from>
  to force a particular module to be loaded. Similarly, the commands
  <scm|lazy-keyboard-force>, <scm|lazy-plugin-force>, <abbr|etc.> may be used
  to force all lazy keyboard definitions <abbr|resp.> plug-ins to be loaded.
  In other words, the use of lazyness forces to make implicit dependencies
  between modules more explicit.

  In the case when you want to redefine keyboard shortcuts, the
  <hlink|contextual overloading system|overview-overloading.en.tm> gives you
  an even more fine-grained control. For instance, assume that the keyboard
  shortcut <key|x x x> has been defined twice, both in general and in math
  mode. After calling <scm|lazy-keyboard-force> and overriding the general
  definition of the shortcut, the special definition will still take
  precedence in math mode. Alternatively, you may redefine the keyboard
  shortcut using

  <\scm-code>
    (kbd-map

    \ \ (:mode prevail?)

    \ \ ("x x x" <em|action>))
  </scm-code>

  This redefinition will prevail both in general and in math mode.

  <tmdoc-title|Table primitives>

  Tables are always present in documents inside evaluable tags which take a
  <markup|tformat> operand. All fundamental table structures have
  inaccessible borders. The basic top-level table tag is <markup|tabular>.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|tformat|with-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|with-n|table><explain-synopsis|table
    formatting container>
  <|explain>
    Every tabular structure in a document contains a <markup|tformat> tag.

    <explain-macro|tformat|table> means the table and cell variables defined
    in the top-level table tag are not modified. The <src-arg|table> argument
    may be a <markup|table> or a nested <markup|tformat> tag, the latter does
    not appear in documents but is produced by the evaluation of the
    top-level tag.

    <explain-macro|tformat|with-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|with-n|table> is
    used when the table contains specific formatting information. The
    <src-arg|with-1> to <src-arg|with-n> arguments must all be <markup|twith>
    or <markup|cwith> tags.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <label|table-twith><explain-macro|twith|var|val><explain-synopsis|set a
    table variable>
  <|explain>
    The formatting of the table as a whole is specified by a number of
    <em|table variables>, which are used internally and do not appear in the
    environment like regular typesetter variables.

    The <markup|twith> primitive<verbatim|> sets the table variable
    <src-arg|var> (literal string) to the value <src-arg|val> (evaluated).
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <label|table-cwith><explain-macro|cwith|top-row|bot-row|left-col|right-col|var|val><explain-synopsis|set
    a cell variable for a range>
  <|explain>
    The formatting of cells is specified by a number of <em|cell variables>,
    which are used internally and do not appear in the environment like
    regular typesetter variables. Rows, columns, and generally any
    rectangular range of cells can associated to a cell variable setting by a
    single <markup|cwith> tag.

    The <markup|cwith> primitive sets the cell variable <src-arg|var>
    (literal string) to the value <src-arg|val> (evaluated) for the range of
    cells spanning rows <src-arg|top-row> to <src-arg|bot-row> and columns
    <src-arg|left-col> to <src-arg|right-col> (literal non-zero integers).

    Range coordinates must be non-zero literal integers, positive values are
    counted left to right and top to bottom, negative values are counted
    right to left and bottom to top. For example, 2 means the second row or
    column and -1 means the last row or column.

    Typical values for <with|mode|math|(<with|mode|text|<src-arg|top-row>>,<with|mode|text|<src-arg|bot-row>>,<with|mode|text|<src-arg|left-col>>,<with|mode|text|<src-arg|right-col>>)>
    are <with|mode|math|(r,r,<op|>1,<op|->1)> for ``row <with|mode|math|r>'',
    <with|mode|math|(<op|>1,<op|->1,c,c)> for ``column <with|mode|math|c>'',
    and <with|mode|math|(r,r,c,c)> for ``the cell at row <with|mode|math|r>,
    column <with|mode|math|c>''. When new cells are inserted, it makes a
    difference whether the rows are counted from the top or bottom, and the
    columns are counted from the left or right. If <with|mode|math|m> is the
    number of rows and <with|mode|math|n> the number of columns, then
    <with|mode|math|r> and <with|mode|math|r-m-1> represent the same
    row<emdash>the former is relative to the top border while the latter is
    relative the bottom border. Similarly, <with|mode|math|c> and
    <with|mode|math|c-n-1> represent the same column.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|table|row-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|row-n><explain-synopsis|row
    container>
  <|explain>
    The only purpose of the <markup|table> tag is to contain <markup|row>
    tags. The number of rows in a table is the number of subtrees in its
    <markup|table> tag.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|row|cell-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|cell-k><explain-synopsis|cell
    container>
  <|explain>
    The only purpose of the <markup|row> tag is to contain <markup|cell>
    tags. All <markup|row> tags in a given <markup|table> must have exactly
    as many subtrees, all <markup|cell> tags, as there are columns in the
    table.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|cell|content><explain-synopsis|cell data container>
  <|explain>
    Table cells can contain any document fragment. A <markup|cell> may
    directly contain an <re-index|inline content> tag or a <markup|concat>,
    if it has <re-index|block content> it must always contain a
    <markup|document> tree.

    A <markup|cell> whose operand is a <markup|document> is a
    <def-index|multi-paragraph cell>. Since tables are allowed in
    <re-index|line context>, this is the only construct which allows,
    indirectly, the nesting of a <re-index|block context> within a
    <re-index|line context>. Note that most block content can only be typeset
    correctly within an hyphenated cell, this is controlled by the
    <src-var|cell-hyphen> table variable.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|subtable|table><explain-synopsis|subtable cell data>
  <|explain>
    In addition to regular markup, cells can accept
    <markup|><markup|subtable> as an operand. The operand of
    <markup|subtable> is a <markup|tformat> tree containing regular table
    data.

    A similar effect can be obtained with normal table by setting the cell's
    padding to zero in all directions, the extra twist of a <markup|subtable>
    is its inaccessible border positions.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|tmarker|table><explain-synopsis|decoration origin marker>
  <|explain>
    This tag is used in the definition of cell decorations, see the
    documentation of the <src-var|cell-decoration> environment variable.

    It is also used outside tables, in the <markup|switch> tag to mark the
    currently displayed position.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|tabular|table><explain-synopsis|built-in tabular macro>
  <|explain>
    This macro implements standard left aligned tables without borders.
    Although the <markup|tabular> macro is built-in into <TeXmacs>, it should
    not really be considered as a primitive. However, it is not part of any
    style file either.

  <tmdoc-title|Matching regular expressions>

  Regular expressions naturally generalize from strings to trees and allow to
  test whether a given tree matches a given pattern. <TeXmacs> implements the
  primitives <scm|match?> and <scm|match> for this purpose, which also
  provide support for wildcards, user-defined grammars and more.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(match? <scm-arg|expr> <scm-arg|pattern>)><explain-synopsis|check
    whether a scheme expression satisfies a pattern>
  <|explain>
    This function determines whether a scheme expression <scm-arg|expr>
    satisfies a given <scm-arg|pattern>. It will be detailed below how to
    form valid patterns. The pattern may contain named wildcards, in case of
    success, we return a list with matches for these wildcards. In case of
    failure, we return<nbsp><scm|#f>. The expression <scm|expr> may contain
    trees, in which case we understand that such tree subexpressions should
    match their scheme counterparts. For instance, <scm|(match? (tree "x")
    "x<name|">)> will return<nbsp><scm|(())>, whereas <scm|(match? (tree "x")
    "y<name|">)> returns <scm|#f>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(match <scm-arg|l> <scm-arg|pattern>
    <scm-arg|bindings>)><explain-synopsis|solutions to a given pattern under
    bindings>
  <|explain>
    Given a list <scm-arg|l> of scheme expressions, a <scm-arg|pattern> with
    free variables and an association list of <scm-arg|bindings>, this
    routine determines all substitutions of free variables by values
    (extending the given <scm-arg|bindings>), for which <scm-arg|l> matches
    the <scm-arg|pattern>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(define-regexp-grammar <scm-args|rules>)><explain-synopsis|user
    defined matching grammars>
  <|explain>
    Given a list of rules of the form <scm|(:<scm-arg|var>
    <scm-arg|pattern-1> ... <scm-arg|pattern-n>)>, this instruction defines a
    new terminal symbol <scm|:<scm-arg|var>> for each such rule, which
    matches the disjunction of the patterns <scm-arg|pattern-1> until
    <scm-arg|pattern-n>. This terminal symbol can then be used as an
    abbreviation in matching patterns. Grammar rules may be interdependent.
    See example below.
  </explain>

  Valid patterns are formed in the following ways:

  <\explain>
    <scm-arg|leaf><explain-synopsis|symbols, strings, etc.>
  <|explain>
    A <scm-arg|leaf> is only matched against itself.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(<scm-arg|pattern-1> ... <scm-arg|pattern-n>)><explain-synopsis|lists>
  <|explain>
    In the case when lists <scm|l-1> until <scm|l-n> match
    <scm-arg|pattern-1> until <scm-arg|pattern-n>, their concatenation
    matches the pattern <scm|(<scm-arg|pattern-1> ... <scm-arg|pattern-n>)>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:%1>, <scm|:%2>, <scm|:%3> ..., <scm|:*><explain-synopsis|wildcards>
  <|explain>
    The wildcard <scm|:%n>, where <scm|n> is a number matches any list of
    length <scm|n>. The wildcard <scm|:*> matches any list, including the
    empty list.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|'<scm-arg|var>><explain-synopsis|variables>
  <|explain>
    This pattern attempts to bind the variable <scm-arg|var> against the
    expression. If <scm-arg|var> is used only once, then it essentially
    behaves as a wildcard. More generally, it can be used to form patterns
    with identical subexpressions. For instance, the pattern <scm|(frac 'x
    'x)> will match all fractions <math|<frac|x|x>>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:<scm-arg|var>><explain-synopsis|user-provided grammar rules>
  <|explain>
    In the case when <scm|:<scm-arg|var>> is a user-provided terminal symbol
    (see <scm|define-regexp-grammar> above), this pattern matches the
    corresponding grammar.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:<scm-arg|pred?>><explain-synopsis|arbitrary <scheme> predicates>
  <|explain>
    Given a <scheme> predicate <scm-arg|pred?>, such as <scm|string?>, this
    pattern matches any scheme expression which satisfies the predicate.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:not <scm-arg|pattern>)>

    <scm|(:or <scm-arg|pattern-1> ... <scm-arg|pattern-n>)>

    <scm|(:and <scm-arg|pattern-1> ... <scm-arg|pattern-n>)><explain-synopsis|logical
    operations>
  <|explain>
    Negation, disjunction and conjunction of patterns.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:repeat <scm-arg|pattern>)><explain-synopsis|repetition>
  <|explain>
    Given lists <scm|l-1> until <scm|l-n> which match <scm-arg|pattern>,
    their concatenation matches the repetition <scm|(:repeat
    <scm-arg|pattern>)>. In particular, the empty list is matched.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:group <scm-arg|pattern-1> ... <scm-arg|pattern-n>)><explain-synopsis|grouping>
  <|explain>
    Groups a concatenation of patterns into a new list patterns. For
    instance, all lists of the form <scm|(a b a b ... a b)> are matched by
    <scm|(:repeat (:group a b))>, whereas <scm|(:repeat (a b))> rather
    matches all lists of the form <scm|((a b) (a b) ... (a b))>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:quote <scm-arg|expr>)><explain-synopsis|quotation>
  <|explain>
    Only matches a given expression <scm-arg|expr>.
  </explain>

  <\example>
    The tree

    <\scm-code>
      (define t '(foo (bar "x") (bar "y") (option "z")))
    </scm-code>

    matches the pattern <scm|(foo (:repeat (bar :%1)) :*)>, but not <scm|(foo
    (:repeat (bar 'x)) :*)>. The call <scm|(match t '(foo 'x 'y :*))> will
    return <scm|(((x . (bar "x")) (y . (bar "y"))))>. Notice that <scm|(x .
    (bar "x"))> will be displayed as <scm|(x bar "x")>:

    <\session|scheme|default>
      <\input|Scheme] >
        (define t '(foo (bar "x") (bar "y") (option "z")))
      </input>

      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (match? t '(foo 'x 'y :*))
      <|unfolded-io>
        (((y bar "y") (x bar "x")))
      </unfolded-io>
    </session>
  </example>

  <\example>
    Consider the grammar

    <\scm-code>
      (define-regexp-grammar

      \ \ (:a a b c)

      \ \ (:b (:repeat :a)))
    </scm-code>

    Then the list <scm|(a b x y c a a)> matches the pattern <scm|(:b :%2
    :b)>.

  <tmdoc-title|Local customization>

  Even though <TeXmacs> tries hard to render source code in a nice way
  following the global rendering options that you specified, the readability
  of the source code often needs to be further enhanced locally. In source
  mode, this can be done using the menus <menu|Source|Activation> and
  <menu|Source|Presentation>. Any local hints on how to render source code
  are automatically removed from the document when it is being used as a
  style file or package.

  First of all, for certain pieces of content the user may prefer to see them
  in their ``activated'' form instead as dead source code. This may for
  instance be the case for embedded images, or for mathematical symbols, like
  in

  <\tm-fragment>
    <with|mode|math|<inactive*|<assign|R|<macro|<active*|\<bbb-R\>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Such an active presentation may also be preferred for certain more complex
  macros:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <with|mode|math|<inactive*|<assign|diag|<macro|var|dim|<active*|<matrix|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<inactive*|<arg|var>><rsub|1>>|<cell|>|<cell|\<b-0\>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|\<ddots\>>|<cell|>>|<row|<cell|\<b-0\>>|<cell|>|<cell|<inactive*|<arg|var>><rsub|<inactive*|<arg|dim>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  A piece of code can be activated by selecting it and using
  <menu|Source|Activation|Activate> or <shortcut|(make-mod-active 'active*)>. Similarly, a piece of
  content may be deactivated using <key|<group|M->-> (we used this in the
  second example above for the rendering of the arguments <src-arg|var> and
  <src-arg|dim>). Activation and deactivation either apply to the whole tree,
  or to the root only (<abbr|e.g.> <menu|Source|Activation|Activate once>).

  Another way to customize the rendering is to override some of the global
  rendering options. This is mainly interesting for controlling more
  precisely which tags have to be stretched across several lines and which
  tags have to be represented in a compact fashion. For instance, the
  <markup|concat> tag can be used in order to concatenate content, as well as
  for specifying a block of sequential statements, or a combination of both.
  For instance, in the piece of code

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|my-section|<macro|title|<style-with|src-compact|none|<header-hook|<arg|title>><toc-hook|<arg|title>><my-section-title|<arg|title>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  we have stretched the <markup|concat> tag along several lines using
  <menu|Source|Presentation|Stretched> (notice that this implies the
  <markup|concat> tag to appear explicitly, so as to avoid confusion with the
  <markup|document> tag). Similarly, if a part of the concatenation were to
  be displayed as usual, then one may use <menu|Source|Presentation|Compact>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|my-section|<macro|title|<style-with|src-compact|none|<header-hook|<arg|title>><toc-hook|<arg|title>><style-with|src-compact|all|<with|font-series|bold|Section:>
    <arg|title>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  At present, we did not implement a way to mark arguments as inline or
  block, but we might do this later.

  A final way to customize the rendering of source code is to apply an
  arbitrary macro using <menu|Source|Presentation|Apply macro> or
  <menu|Source|Presentation|Apply macro once>. This macro will be
  automatically removed when you use your document as a style file or
  package.

  <tmdoc-title|A short description of GNU <TeXmacs>>

  GNU <TeXmacs> is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) editing
  platform with special features for scientists. The software aims to provide
  a unified and user friendly framework for editing structured documents with
  different types of content (text, graphics, mathematics, interactive
  content, <abbr|etc.>). The rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting
  algorithms so as to produce professionally looking documents, which can
  either be printed out or presented from a laptop.

  The software includes a text editor with support for mathematical formulas,
  a small technical picture editor and a tool for making presentations from a
  laptop. Moreover, <TeXmacs> can be used as an interface for many external
  systems for computer algebra, numerical analysis, statistics,<nbsp>etc. New
  presentation styles can be written by the user and new features can be
  added to the editor using the <name|Scheme> extension language. A native
  spreadsheet and tools for collaborative authoring are planned for later.

  <TeXmacs> runs on all major <name|Unix> platforms and <name|Windows>.
  Documents can be saved in <TeXmacs>, <name|Xml> or <name|Scheme> format and
  printed as <name|Postscript> or <name|Pdf> files. Converters exist for
  <TeX>/<LaTeX> and <name|Html>/<name|Mathml>.

  GNU <TeXmacs> is hosted by <hlink|INRIA|http://www.inria.fr>, Btiment
  Allan Turing, Palaiseau, France.

<TeXmacs|1.99.1>

<style|<tuple|tmdoc|english>>

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Search and replace>

  You can start searching text by pressing <key|C-s> or <menu|Edit|Search>.
  Doing this, a new special ``search toolbar'' will appear below the main
  text, just above the footer. When typing text in the search field of the
  toolbar, all occurrences of this text will be highlighted in the main
  document. Moreover, one ``principal'' occurrence will be highlighted in red
  and you may navigate through all occurrences using <key|pageup> and
  <key|pagedown> (or <key|up> and <key|down>, or <key|return>). Using
  <key|home> and <key|end>, you may jump to the first and last occurrences
  respectively. As soon as you press the escape key <key|escape>, the search
  toolbar will be closed, searching stops and focus returns to the main
  document.

  During a search, only text in the same mode and the same language will be
  found, as those which are active at the position where you started your
  search. In other words, when searching an <math|x> in math-mode, you will
  not find any x's in the ordinary text. As a current limitation, the search
  string can only contain ordinary text and no math-symbols or more
  complicated structured text.

  In order to replace text, you should use <menu|Edit|Replace> or press
  <key|C-=>. This will cause a special ``replace toolbar'' to appear below
  the main text, just above the footer. You are prompted for a string which
  is to be replaced and the string by which to replace. Again, you may use
  the <key|pageup> and <key|pagedown> keys in order to navigate through the
  occurrences of the search string. When pressing <key|tab> or <key|return>
  in the search field, focus will be moved to the replace field. You may
  still use the <key|pageup> and <key|pagedown> keys in order to navigate
  through the occurrences of the search string. In addition, pressing
  <key|return> will replace the principal occurrence of the search string by
  the replace string. Using <key|S-return>, you may undo the last
  replacement. You may replace all remaining occurrences by pressing
  <key|C-return>. Like in the case of searching, the query-replace command is
  mode and language sensitive.

  The search and replace toolbars are quite rudimentary in the sense that
  they only allow for searching and replacing plain text. By pressing the
  <icon|tm_expand_tool.xpm> icon on either of these toolbars, you may expand
  the toolbar into a full blown widget with larger search and replace fields
  which may contain arbitrary markup. Searching and replacing can be done
  using more or less the same keyboard shortcuts as in the case of the
  toolbars, but you may now search and replace arbitrary content.

  When searching non textual content, the conditions for having a hit are
  somewhat released. For instance, assume that you are just starting a new
  search with an empty search field. Then typing<nbsp><key|F6> inserts the
  <markup|strong> tag with no text inside yet. Instead of looking only for
  ``strong empty strings'', <TeXmacs> will rather look for all strong markup
  in your document. If you next enter the letter ``a'', then <TeXmacs> will
  look for all strong text which contains the letter ``a''. In a<nbsp>similar
  way, when searching for the formula <math|<frac|x|>>, <TeXmacs> will
  highlight all fractions in which the numerator contains the variable
  <math|x>. Yet another example: a search for <math|<frac||<sqrt|x>>> will
  highlight all formulas in which the denominator contains a square root
  which contains the variable <math|x>. For instance, the fraction
  <math|<frac|a+b|c+<sqrt|x+y>>> will be highlighted, but not
  <math|<frac|<sqrt|x+y>|a+<sqrt|y>>>.

  When using the structured text and replace widgets, <TeXmacs> also
  implements a few additional special tags for enhancing structured
  searching. First of all, it can happen that you would like to search for
  certain content <em|inside> a special context. For instance, you might want
  to search for all occurrences of the letter ``a'' inside a <markup|strong>
  tag. When searching for <strong|a>, as above, <TeXmacs> will highlight all
  <markup|strong> tags which contain the letter ``a''. In order to highlight
  the letters ``a'' themselves, you should first enter the <markup|strong>
  tag inside an empty search field using <key|F6>. You next enter a special
  <markup|select-region> tag using <key|std ?>, and finally insert the letter
  ``a'' inside this tag. Other special markup which can be used inside search
  fields are the ``wildcards'' <math|x>, <math|y> and <math|z> which are
  entered using <key|std 1>, <key|std 2> and <key|std 3>.

  As soon as you start using the structured text and replace widgets instead
  of the toolbars, this will be remembered as a user preference: any
  subsequent searches or replacements will again use the widgets. In order to
  switch back to the less intrusive toolbar methods for searching and
  replacing, you should press the <icon|tm_compress_tool.xpm> icon.

  Before writing your own style file, it may be useful to take a look at some
  standard style files. For instance, you may load <verbatim|book.ts> using
  <submenu|File|load> (no path is necessary here, since the style directory
  is included in the default file path).

  After loading <verbatim|book.ts>, you will see many function and
  environment declarations (these declarations are visible, since style files
  are written in ``preamble mode'' (see <submenu|Options|mode>)). Some more
  declarations are contained in the files <verbatim|basic.ts>,
  <verbatim|list.ts>, <verbatim|theorem.ts> and <verbatim|program.ts> on
  which <verbatim|book.ts> is based. These files respectively contain basic,
  itemize-like, theorem-like and programming environments.

  <tmdoc-title|Structured variants>

  When creating an environment like a theorem, an equation or a list, it
  frequently happens that one would like to change the environment <em|a
  posteriori>. This can be done using the keyboard shortcuts
  <shortcut|(variant-circulate (focus-tree) #t)> and <shortcut|(variant-circulate (focus-tree) #f)> for cycling through the list of
  <em|structured variants> of the innermost tag in a direct or inverse
  manner.

  For instance, assuming that you are inside a theorem, pressing
  <shortcut|(variant-circulate (focus-tree) #t)> several times will change the theorem into a proposition,
  a lemma, a corollary, a conjecture and back into a theorem. The
  <shortcut|(variant-circulate (focus-tree) #f)> key allows you to cycle in the inverse direction:
  theorem<nbsp><with|mode|math|<op|\<rightarrow\>>>
  conjectur<nbsp><with|mode|math|<op|\<rightarrow\>>>
  corollary<nbsp><with|mode|math|<op|\<rightarrow\>>>
  lemma<nbsp><with|mode|math|<op|\<rightarrow\>>>
  proposition<nbsp><with|mode|math|<op|\<rightarrow\>>> theorem.

  In the case of mathematical formulas, the <shortcut|(variant-circulate (focus-tree) #t)> shortcuts
  allows you to change an inline formula like
  <with|mode|math|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>> into a displayed formula
  like

  <\equation*>
    a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>
  </equation*>

  while taking care of potential ``trailing spaces and punctuation signs''.

  <TeXmacs> also provides the <shortcut|(numbered-toggle (focus-tree))> shortcut for turning numbered
  environments into unnumbered environments and <em|vice versa>. This works
  for most common environments like theorems, remarks, tables, equations,
  etc. Notice that <shortcut|(numbered-toggle (focus-tree))> also turns an unnumbered itemize environment
  into an enumeration and <em|vice versa>, whereas <shortcut|(variant-circulate (focus-tree) #t)> allows
  you to cycle between the available kinds of list items (bullets, dashes,
  arrows, <abbr|etc.>).

  </big-table|Big mathematical operators.>

  The scopes of big operators are indicated visually, through the light cyan
  boxes around the tags which contain the cursor.

  The big integral signs admit two variants, depending on where you want to
  place subscripts and superscripts. By default, the scripts are placed as
  follows:

  <\equation*>
    <big-around|\<int\>|<rsub|0><rsup|\<infty\>><frac|\<mathd\>
    x|1+x<rsup|2>>>.
  </equation*>

  The alternative rendering ``with limits''

  <\equation*>
    <big-around|\<intlim\>|<rsub|0><rsup|\<infty\>><frac|\<mathd\>
    x|1+x<rsup|2>>>.
  </equation*>

  is obtained using <key|symbol L I>. Similarly, you may type <key|symbol L
  O> in order to obtain <math|<big-around|\<oint\>|>> with limits.

  </scm-code>

  or

  <\scm-code>

  Here <scm-arg|def> is a program which represents the entries of the menu.
  In particular, you may take a look at the files in the directory

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/menu
  </verbatim>

  in order to see how the standard <TeXmacs> menus are defined. In the case
  of <scm|tm-menu>, it is possible to specify additional arguments, which
  makes it possible to dynamically construct more complex menus which depend
  on parameters.

  More precisely, the program <verbatim|<em|def>> in <scm|menu-bind> or
  <scm|tm-menu> is a list of entries of one of the following forms:

  <\scm-code>
    (=\<gtr\> "pulldown menu name" <scm-arg|menu-definition>)

    (-\<gtr\> "pullright menu name" <scm-arg|menu-definition>)

    ("entry" <scm-arg|action>)

    (if <scm-arg|condition> <scm-arg|menu-definition>)

    (when condition menu-definition)

    (link <scm-arg|variable>)

    (former)
  </scm-code>

  The constructors <scm|=\<gtr\>> and <scm|-\<gtr\>> are used to create
  <with|font-shape|italic|pulldown> or <with|font-shape|italic|pullright>
  menus and <scm-arg|menu-definition> should contain a program which creates
  the submenu. In the main (or system) menu bar all root items are pulldown
  menus and all submenus of these are pullright. Both pulldown and pullright
  may be used in toolbars or other widgets.

  The constructor <scm|("entry" <scm-arg|action>)> creates an ordinary entry,
  where <scm-arg|action> will be compiled and executed when you click on
  <scm|entry>. Items of a menu may be separated using <verbatim|--->. The
  constructor <scm|if> is used for inserting menu items only if a certain
  <scm-arg|condition> is satisfied (for instance, if we are in math mode),
  whereas <scm|while> always inserts the item but deactivates (e.g. greying
  it out) it <scm-arg|condition> is not met.

  If you declared a menu <scm-arg|name>, then you may use this menu
  indirectly using the <scm|link> constructor, thus one may link any such
  ``indirect'' submenu to as many menus as desired.

  Finally, new items may be added to any given menu <with|font-shape|italic|a
  posteriori> using <scm|former>, as in the following example:

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-menu (tools-menu)

    \ \ (former)

    \ \ ---

    \ \ ("New item" (noop)))
  </scm-code>

  The main <TeXmacs> menus are:

  <\itemize-dot>
    <item><scm|texmacs-menu>: contains the root entries of the main menu bar
    at the top of the window (or desktop under <name|MacOS>). It uses
    <scm|link> to display <scm|file-menu>, <scm|edit-menu>,
    <scm|insert-menu>, <scm|text-menu>, <scm|paragraph-menu>,
    <scm|document-menu> and <scm|help-menu> among others.

    <item><scm|texmacs-main-icons>: contains the main toolbar, which
    typically features buttons to open and save files, copy and paste text,
    etc.

    <item><scm|texmacs-mode-icons>: contains the icons which depend on the
    current editing mode, that is: mathematics, text, code, etc.

    <item><scm|texmacs-focus-icons>: these icons change with the cursor. One
    should install here any icons that are specific to a particular tag or
    context.

    <item><scm|texmacs-extra-icons>: custom icons for user extensions.

    <item><scm|texmacs-popup-menu>: the menu which pops up when the user
    right-clicks on a <TeXmacs> document. Extending or replacing this menu is
    useful for instance for plugin writers: you may want to display some
    extra actions while removing others when the user in inside a session for
    your plugin.

<TeXmacs|1.0.3.7>

<style|tmdoc>

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Evaluation control>

  The <menu|Source|Evaluation> menu contains several primitives to control
  the way expressions in the style-sheet language are evaluated. The most
  frequent use of these primitives is when you want to write a ``meta-macro''
  like <markup|new-theorem> which is used for defining or computing on other
  macros. For instance:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|new-theorem|<macro|name|text|<quasi|<assign|<unquote|name>|<macro|body|<surround|<no-indent><strong|<unquote|<arg|text>>.
    >|<right-flush>|<arg|body>>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  When calling <inactive*|<new-theorem|theorem|Theorem>> in this example, we
  first evaluate all <markup|unquote> instructions inside the <markup|quasi>
  primitive, which yields the expression

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|theorem|<macro|body|<surround|<no-indent><strong|Theorem.
    >|<right-flush>|<arg|body>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Next, this expression is evaluated, thereby defining a macro
  <markup|theorem>.

  It should be noticed that the <TeXmacs> conventions for evaluation are
  slightly different then those from conventional functional languages like
  <name|Scheme>. The subtle differences are motivated by our objective to
  make it as easy as possible for the user to write macros for typesetting
  purposes.

  For instance, when <TeXmacs> calls a macro
  <inactive*|<macro|<active*|x<rsub|1>>|<active*|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>>|<active*|x<rsub|n>>|body>>
  with arguments <verbatim|y<rsub|1>> until <verbatim|y<rsub|n>>, the
  argument variables <src-arg|x<rsub|1>> until <src-arg|x<rsub|n>> are bound
  to the unevaluated expressions <verbatim|y<rsub|1>> until
  <verbatim|y<rsub|n>>, and the body is evaluated with these bindings. The
  evaluation of <verbatim|y<rsub|i>> takes place each time we request for the
  argument <no-break><src-arg|x<rsub|i>>. In particular, when applying the
  macro <inactive*|<macro|x|<arg|x> and again <arg|x>>> to an expression
  <verbatim|y>, the expression <no-break><verbatim|y> is evaluated twice.

  In <name|Scheme>, the bodies of <name|Scheme> macros are evaluated twice,
  whereas the arguments of functions are evaluated. On the other hand, when
  retrieving a variable (whether it is an argument or an environment
  variable), the value is not evaluated. Consequently, a <TeXmacs> macro

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|foo|<macro|x|<blah|<arg|x>|<arg|x>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  would correspond to a <name|Scheme> macro

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (define-macro (foo x)

    \ \ `(let ((x (lambda () ,x)))

    \ \ \ \ \ (blah (x) (x)))
  </scheme-fragment>

  Conversely, the <name|Scheme> macro and function

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (define-macro (foo x) (blah x x))

    (define (fun x) (blah x x))
  </scheme-fragment>

  admit the following analogues in <TeXmacs>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <assign|foo|<macro|x|<eval|<blah|<quote-arg|x>|<quote-arg|x>>>>>
    </inactive*>

    <\inactive*>
      <assign|fun|<macro|x|<with|x*|<arg|x>|<blah|<quote-value|x*>|<quote-value|x*>>>>>
    </inactive*>
  </tm-fragment>

  Here the primitives <markup|quote-arg> and <markup|quote-value> are used to
  retrieve the value of an argument <abbr|resp.> an environment variable. The
  <TeXmacs> primitives <markup|eval>, <markup|quote>, <markup|quasiquote> and
  <markup|unquote> behave in the same way as their <name|Scheme> analogues.
  The <markup|quasi> primitive is a shortcut for quasi-quotation followed by
  evaluation.

  <tmdoc-title|Internal primitives>

  The primitives in this section are merely for internal use by <TeXmacs>
  only. They are documented for the sake of completeness, but you should only
  use them if you really know what you are doing.

  <\explain|<explain-macro|uninit><explain-synopsis|unknown content or
  unintialized data>>
    This primitive is mainly used for default uninialized value of
    environment variables; the main advantage of this tag is to be distinct
    from the empty string.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|unknown><explain-synopsis|unknown content or
  unintialized data>>
    This primitive is mainly used for default uninialized value of
    environment variables; the main advantage of this tag is to be distinct
    from the empty string.

    This value is less likely to be encountered than <src-macro|uninit>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|error|message><explain-synopsis|error messages>>
    This primitive should never appear in documents. It is provided as aid in
    tracking down invalid constructs. It is produced at evaluation time by
    any kind of primitive which is given improper operands.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|collection|binding-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|binding-n>

    <explain-macro|associate|key|value><explain-synopsis|collections of
    bindings>
  <|explain>
    The <markup|collection> tag is used to represent hashtables with bindings
    <src-arg|binding-1> until <src-arg|binding-n>. Each binding is of the
    form <explain-macro|associate|key|value>, with a <src-arg|key> and an
    associated <src-arg|value>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|attr|key-1|val-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|key-n|val-n><explain-synopsis|XML-like
    attributes>
  <|explain>
    This tag is included for future compatibility with XML. It is used for
    encoding XML-style attributes by <TeXmacs> trees. For instance, the
    fragment

    <\quote-env>
      <framed-fragment|<\verbatim>
        \<less\>blah color="blue" emotion="verbose"\<gtr\>

        \ \ Some XML stuff

        \<less\>/blah\<gtr\>
      </verbatim>>
    </quote-env>

    would typically be represented as

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<blah|<attr|color|blue|emotion|verbose>|Some XML stuff>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|tag|content|annotation>

    <explain-macro|meaning|content|annotation><explain-synopsis|associate a
    meaning to some content>
  <|explain>
    Associate a special meaning to some <src-arg|content>. Currently, no real
    use has been made of these tags.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|backup|save|stack><explain-synopsis|save values on stack>
  <|explain>
    Used to represent temporarily saved values on a stack.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|dbox><explain-synopsis|marker for decorations>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is only intended for internal use by the <markup|datoms>,
    <markup|dlines> and <markup|dpages> primitives.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|rewrite-inactive|t|var><explain-synopsis|internal
    primitive for rendering inactive markup>
  <|explain>
    This internal primitive is used for rewriting an inactive tree into a new
    tree whose rendering corresponds to the rendering of the inactive tree.
    It may be successfully invoked from within a macro.

    e.g. <inactive*|<assign|show-inactive|<macro|x|<rewrite-inactive|<arg|x>|>>>>

    which might be invoked to show itself or another assigned variable using
    <src-macro|quasiquote> in this manner:
    <inactive*|<quasiquote|<show-inactive|<unquote|<value|show-inactive>>>>>

    \;
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|new-dpage>

    <explain-macro|new-dpage*><explain-synopsis|new double page>
  <|explain>
    Yet to be implemented primitives for starting a new double page.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|identity|markup><explain-synopsis|identity macro>
  <|explain>
    The identity macro is built-in into <TeXmacs>. It should not really be
    considered as a primitive, but it is not part of any style file either.
  </explain>

  In addition to these primitives for internal use only, there are also quite
  a few obsolete primitives, which are no longer being used by <TeXmacs>, but
  whose names should be avoided when creating your own macros. The full list
  of obsolete primitives is: <markup|format>, <markup|line-sep>,
  <markup|with-limits>, <markup|split>, <markup|old-matrix>,
  <markup|old-table>, <markup|old-mosaic>, <markup|old-mosaic-item>,
  <markup|set>, <markup|reset>, <markup|expand>, <markup|expand*>,
  <markup|hide-expand>, <markup|apply>, <markup|begin>, <markup|end>,
  <markup|func>, <markup|env>, <markup|authorize>.

  <tmdoc-title|Conventions for this manual>

  <paragraph*|Menu entries>

  Throughout the <TeXmacs> manual, menu entries will be typeset using a
  <em|sans serif> font, like in <menu|Document>, <menu|File|Load> or
  <menu|Format|Font shape|Italic>.

  <paragraph*|Keyboard modifiers>

  <TeXmacs> makes use of the following keyboard modifiers:

  <\description>
    <item*|<prefix|S->>For shift key combinations.

    <item*|<prefix|C->>For control key combinations.

    <item*|<prefix|A->>For alternate key combinations.

    <item*|<prefix|M->>For meta key combinations.
  </description>

  For instance, <key*|M-S-x> stands for the action which consists of
  simultaneously pressing the three keys <prefix|M->, <prefix|S-> and
  <key|x>.

  <paragraph*|Keyboard shortcuts>

  More complex keyboard shortcuts are obtain by pressing several keys or
  ``modified keys'' in succession. For instance, the shortcut <key|- \<gtr\>>
  corresponds on first pressing the <key|-> key and then the key
  <key|\<gtr\>>. Inside mathematical formulas, this shortcut inserts the
  arrow <math|<op|\<rightarrow\>>>. Similarly, the shortcut <key*|C-x C-f>
  consists of first pressing the keys <prefix|C-> and <key|x> together, and
  next pressing the keys <prefix|C-> and <key|f> again together. In the
  <name|Emacs> ``look and feel'', this shortcut enables you to open a new
  file.

  Some common keyboard prefixes are detailed in the section on <hlink|general
  keyboard rules|../text/keyboard/man-general-rules.en.tm>. In cases when
  <TeXmacs> keyboard shortcuts are superseded by shortcuts from the operating
  system, we notice that <hlink|equivalents for the keyboard
  modifiers|../config/man-config-keyboard.en.tm#kbd-escape-table> can be
  obtained using the <key*|escape> key. For instance, <key*|escape> is
  equivalent to <key|escape> and <key*|escape escape> is equivalent to
  <key|escape escape>.

  Notice that the <TeXmacs> menus and keyboard behavior are <em|contextual>,
  <abbr|i.e.> they depend on the current mode (i.e. text mode or ``math
  mode''), the current language and the position of the cursor inside your
  document. For instance, inside math mode, you have special keyboard
  shortcuts which are handy for typing mathematical formulas, but which are
  useless in text mode.

  <paragraph*|Special keys>

  On some platforms, some special keys such as the Return key are depicted by
  short glyphs. Below follows the table with all such special keys and there
  meaning.

  <\big-table|<descriptive-table|<tformat|<cwith|1|-1|3|3|cell-lborder|1ln>|<cwith|1|-1|1|-1|cell-halign|l>|<cwith|1|-1|1|-1|cell-row-span|1>|<cwith|1|-1|1|-1|cell-col-span|1>|<cwith|7|11|1|1|cell-lborder|1ln>|<cwith|7|11|1|2|cell-halign|l>|<cwith|7|11|1|2|cell-row-span|1>|<cwith|7|11|1|2|cell-col-span|1>|<table|<row|<cell|Key>|<cell|Meaning>|<cell|Key>|<cell|Meaning>>|<row|<cell|<key*|S->>|<cell|Shift

  <tmdoc-title|Function definition and contextual overloading>

  Conventional programming languages often provide some means to overload
  certain functions depending on the types of the arguments. <TeXmacs>
  provides additional context-based overloading mechanisms, which require the
  use of the <scm|tm-define> construct for function definitions (and
  <scm|tm-define-macro> for macro definitions). Definition with
  <scm|tm-define> also allows the specification of properties of the
  function/macro: arguments, synopsis, etc.

  Furthermore, one may use <scm|tm-property> for associating additional
  properties, such as interactivity or default values for the arguments, of a
  function <em|which is already defined>, specifically functions exported
  from <c++> code through the glue.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tm-define <scm-arg|head> <scm-args|options>
    <scm-args|body>)><explain-synopsis|<TeXmacs> function definition>

    <scm|(tm-define-macro <scm-arg|head> <scm-args|options>
    <scm-args|body>)><explain-synopsis|<TeXmacs> macro definition>
  <|explain>
    <TeXmacs> function and macro declarations are similar to usual
    declarations based on <scm|define> and <scm|define-macro>, except for the
    additional list of <scm-arg|options> and the fact that all functions and
    macros defined using <scm|tm-define> and <scm|tm-define-macro> are
    public. Each option is of the form <scm|(:<scm-arg|kind>
    <scm-args|arguments>)> and the <scm-arg|body> starts at the first element
    of the list following <scm-arg|head> which is not of this form. Available
    options are <scm|:type>, <scm|:synopsis>, <scm|:returns>, <scm|:note>,
    <scm|:argument>, <scm|:default>, <scm|:proposals>, <scm|:secure>,
    <scm|:check-mark>, <scm|:interactive> and <scm|:balloon>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tm-property <scm-arg|head> <scm-args|options>)><explain-synopsis|<TeXmacs>
    properties definition>
  <|explain>
    <scm|tm-property> allows the declaration of <TeXmacs> properties for
    functions which have already been defined, specifically for functions
    exported through the glue. Available options are <scm|:type>,
    <scm|:synopsis>, <scm|:returns>, <scm|:note>, <scm|:argument>,
    <scm|:default>, <scm|:proposals>, <scm|:secure>, <scm|:check-mark>,
    <scm|:interactive> and <scm|:balloon>.
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Contextual overloading>

  We will first describe the most important <scm|:require> option for
  contextual overloading, which was already discussed
  <hlink|before|../overview/overview-overloading.en.tm>.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:require <scm-arg|cond>)><explain-synopsis|argument based
    overloading>
  <|explain>
    This option specifies that one necessary condition for the declaration to
    be valid is that the condition <scm-arg|cond> is met. This condition may
    involve the arguments of the function.

    As an example, let us consider the following definitions:

    <\scm-code>
      (tm-define (special t)

      \ \ (and-with p (tree-outer t)

      \ \ \ \ (special p)))

      \;

      (tm-define (special)

      \ \ (:require (tree-is? t 'frac))

      \ \ (tree-set! t `(frac ,(tree-ref t 1) ,(tree-ref t 0))))

      \;

      (tm-define (special)

      \ \ (:require (tree-is? t 'rsub))

      \ \ (tree-set! t `(rsup ,(tree-ref t 0))))
    </scm-code>

    The default implementation of <scm|special> is to apply <scm|special> to
    the parent <scm|p> of <scm|t> as long as <scm|t> is not the entire
    document itself. The two overloaded cases apply when <scm|t> is either a
    fraction or a right subscript.

    Assuming that your cursor is inside a fraction inside a subscript,
    calling <scm|special> will swap the numerator and the denominator. On the
    other hand, if your cursor is inside a subscript inside a fraction, then
    calling <scm|special> will change the subscript into a superscript.

    When the conditions of several (re)declarations are met, then the last
    redeclaration will be used. Inside a redeclaration, one may also use the
    <scm|former> keyword in order to explicitly access the former value of
    the redefined symbol.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:mode <scm-arg|mode>)><explain-synopsis|mode-based overloading>
  <|explain>
    This option is equivalent to <scm|(:require (<scm-arg|mode>))> and
    specifies that the definition is only valid when we are in a given
    <scm-arg|mode>. New modes are defined using <scm|texmacs-modes> and modes
    can inherit from other modes.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(texmacs-modes . <scm-arg|modedefs>)> <explain-synopsis|define new
    texmacs modes>
  <|explain>
    Use this macro to define new modes that you can use for contextual
    overloading, for instance in <scm|kbd-map>. Modes may be made dependent
    on other modes. This macro takes a variable number of definitions as
    arguments, each of the form <scm|(mode-name conditions . dependencies)>.
    End your <scm|mode-name> and any dependencies with one <scm|%>, like
    this:

    <\scm-code>
      (texmacs-modes

      \ \ (in-verbatim% (inside? 'verbatim) in-text%)

      \ \ (in-tt% (inside? 'tt)))
    </scm-code>

    When creating new modes remember to place first the faster checks
    (against booleans, etc.) for speed.
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Other options for function and macro declarations>

  Besides the contextual overloading options, the <scm|tm-define> and
  <scm|tm-define-macro> primitives admit several other options for attaching
  additional information to the function or macro. We will now describe these
  options and explain how the additional information attached to functions
  can be exploited.

  <\warning>
    A current limitation of the implementation is that functions overloaded
    using <scm|:require> and <scm|:mode> cannot have different options. This
    means in particular that you cannot specify different values for
    <scm|:synopsis> depending on the context.
  </warning>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:synopsis <scm-arg|short-help>)><explain-synopsis|short
    description>
  <|explain>
    This option gives a short discription of the function or macro, in the
    form of a string <scm-arg|short-help>. As a convention, <scheme>
    expressions may be encoded inside this string by using the
    <verbatim|@>-prefix. For instance:

    <\scm-code>
      (tm-define (list-square l)

      \ \ (:synopsis "Appends the list @l to itself")

      \ \ (append l l))
    </scm-code>

    The synopsis of a function is used for instance in order to provide a
    short help string for the function. In the future, we might also use it
    for help balloons describing menu items.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:argument <scm-arg|var> <scm-arg|description>)>

    <scm|(:argument <scm-arg|var> <scm-arg|type>
    <scm-arg|description>)><explain-synopsis|argument description>
  <|explain>
    This option gives a short <scm-arg|description> of one of the arguments
    <scm-arg|var> to the function or macro. Such a description is used for
    instance for the prompts, when calling the function interactively. For
    these uses, the second format allows for the specification of a
    <scm-arg|type> which changes how the widgets/prompts work. Some allowed
    values are <scm|"string">, the default, and <scm|"file"> and
    <scm|"directory">. If any of the last two is specified, tab completion in
    the interactive prompt will traverse the file system.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:returns <scm-arg|description>)><explain-synopsis|return value
    description>
  <|explain>
    This option gives a short <scm-arg|description> of the return value of
    the function or macro.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:type (-\<gtr\> <scm-arg|from> <scm-arg|to>))><explain-synopsis|type
    conversion description>
  <|explain>
    This option specifies that a function or macro performs a conversion from
    the data type <scm-arg|from> to the data type <scm-arg|to>.

  <tmdoc-title|Exporting beamer presentations>

  Once you have created a file with the <tmstyle|beamer> style you may want
  to export it to <abbr|PDF> in order to be able to give your presentation
  without using <TeXmacs>. There are two ways in which this can be done:
  <em|expanded> and <em|unexpanded>.

  <\enumerate>
    <item><em|Expanded> means that <markup|fold>s of all kinds are
    ``flattened'' out before they are exported. This is useful if you intend
    the resulting <abbr|PDF> file to be distributed and printed, since it
    will have exactly as many pages as slides your presentation.

    <item><em|Unexpanded> means that the <abbr|PDF> file will have as many
    pages as <em|steps> your presentation, which depending on your use of
    <markup|fold>, <markup|switch>, <markup|overlay>, etc. will typically
    result in many more pages.
  </enumerate>

  You can select which of these methods will be used with
  <menu|Preferences|Converters|TeXmacs-\<gtr\>Pdf/Postscript|Expand beamer
  slides>.

  <tmdoc-title|Structured cursor movement>

  <TeXmacs> implements the three main mechanisms for <em|structured cursor
  movement>:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>Traversal of the entire structure of the document.

    <item>Traversal of tags which are similar to the innermost tag.

    <item>Movements inside the innermost tag.
  </enumerate>

  Most keyboard shortcuts for structured cursor movements can be used in
  combination with the<nbsp><prefix|S->-key so as to similtaneously select
  text while moving around.

  <todo|customizing the behaviour>

  <paragraph*|Structured traversal of the document>

  The <shortcut|(traverse-left)>, <shortcut|(traverse-right)>,
  <shortcut|(traverse-up)> and <shortcut|(traverse-down)> keys are used for
  the structured traversal of the entire document. Inside plain text,
  <shortcut|(traverse-left)> and <shortcut|(traverse-right)> allow you to
  move in a word-by-word manner, while <shortcut|(traverse-up)> and
  <shortcut|(traverse-down)> correspond to paragraph-by-paragraph motion.

  In the presence of other markup, the <shortcut|(traverse-left)> and
  <shortcut|(traverse-right)> keys allow you to visit all accessible cursor
  positions of the document, except that we keep moving in a word-by-word
  manner inside plain text. The behaviour of the <shortcut|(traverse-up)> and
  <shortcut|(traverse-down)> keys is more context-dependent. Inside matrices,
  they typically allow you to move one row up or down.

  <paragraph*|Traversal of tags which are similar to the innermost tag>

  This type of cursor movement allows you to quickly visit all other tags in
  the document which are <em|similar> to the innermost tag. The
  <shortcut|(traverse-previous)> and <shortcut|(traverse-next)> keys allow
  you move to the previous or next similar tags, whereas
  <shortcut|(traverse-first)> and <shortcut|(traverse-last)> directly jump to
  the first or last similar tags.

  For instance, when you are inside a section title, you may move to the
  previous sectional title (which could also be the title of a subsection or
  a chapter, for instance) using <shortcut|(traverse-previous)>. Notice that
  you may use <key|C-> to jump to the previous section title.

  <paragraph*|Movements inside the innermost tag>

  It is also possible to quickly move inside the innermost tag without
  quitting it. The shortcuts <shortcut|(structured-left)>,
  <shortcut|(structured-right)>, <shortcut|(structured-start)> and
  <shortcut|(structured-end)> provide a way to move to the previous, next,
  first or last argument of the innermost tag. Furthermore, the shortcuts
  <shortcut|(structured-exit-left)> and <shortcut|(structured-exit-right)>
  may be used to exit the innermost tag on the left or on the right.

  This default behaviour may be overridden in special contexts. For instance,
  inside tables or trees, they rather correspond to cell-by-cell or
  node-by-node cursor movement. In addition, these cases associate vertical
  cursor movements to <shortcut|(structured-up)>,
  <shortcut|(structured-down)>, <shortcut|(structured-top)>
  and<nbsp><shortcut|(structured-bottom)>.

  <tmdoc-title|Miscellaneous style-sheet primitives>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|extern|scheme-foo|arg-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|arg-n><explain-synopsis|apply
    extern typesetting macro>
  <|explain>
    This primitive allows the user to implement macros in <scheme>. The
    primitive applies the <scheme> function or macro <src-arg|scheme-foo> to
    the arguments <src-arg|arg-1> until <src-arg|arg-n>. For instance, the
    code <inactive*|<extern|(lambda (name) `(concat "hi " ,name))|dude>>
    yields ``<extern|(lambda (name) `(concat "hi " ,name))|dude>''.

    The arguments <src-arg|arg-1> until <src-arg|arg-n> are evaluated and
    then passed as trees to <src-arg|scheme-foo>. When defining a macro which
    relies on extern scheme code, it is therefore recommended to pass the
    macro arguments using the <markup|quote-arg> primitive:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|inc-div|<macro|x|y|<style-with|src-compact|none|<extern|(lambda
      (x y) `(frac ,x (concat "1+" ,y)))|<quote-arg|x>|<quote-arg|y>>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    It has been foreseen that the accessability of the macro arguments
    <src-arg|x> and <src-arg|y> is preserved for this kind of definitions.
    However, since <TeXmacs> does not heuristically analyze your <scheme>
    code, you will have to manually set the <abbr|D.R.D.> properties using
    <markup|drd-props>.

    Notice also that the <scheme> function <src-arg|scheme-foo> should only
    rely on secure scheme functions (and not on functions like
    <verbatim|system> which may erase your hard disk). User implemented
    <scheme> functions in plug-ins may be defined to be secure using the
    <verbatim|:secure> option. Alternatively, the user may define all
    <scheme> routines to be secure in <menu|Edit|Preferences|Security|Accept
    all scripts>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|write|aux|content><explain-synopsis|write auxiliary
    information>
  <|explain>
    Adds <src-arg|content> to the auxiliary section <src-arg|aux> of the
    document. This tag is used for instance by <inactive*|<nocite|citekey>>
    to add entries to the automatically generated bibliography at the end of
    the document, without inserting a citation in the text.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|flag|content|color>

    <explain-macro|flag|content|color|var><explain-synopsis|display an
    informative flag>
  <|explain>
    This tag is used to in order to inform the user about information which
    is present in the document, but not visible when printed out. <TeXmacs>
    displays such informative flags for labels, formatting directives such as
    page breaks, and so on. In <menu|Document|Informative flags>, the user
    may specify how the informative flags should be rendered.

    The two-argument variant displays an informative flag with a given
    <src-arg|content> and <src-arg|color>. The <src-arg|content> is only
    rendered when selecting <menu|Document|Informative flags|Detailed>. For
    instance, <inactive*|<flag|warning|red>> is rendered as
    <flag|warning|red>. The optional <src-arg|var> argument may be used in
    order to specify that the flag should only be visible if the macro
    argument <src-arg|var> corresponds to an accessible part of the document.
    For instance, <TeXmacs> automatically generates labels for section titles
    (so as to include them in the table of contents), but it is undesirable
    to display informative flags for such labels.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Generating a table of contents>

  It is very easy to generate a table of contents for your document. Just put
  your cursor at the place where you want your table of contents and click on
  <apply|menu|Insert|Automatic|Table of contents>.

  In order to generate the table of contents, you should be in a mode where
  page breaks are visible (select paper in <apply|menu|Document|Page|Type>),
  so that the appropriate references to page numbers can be computed. Next,
  use <apply|menu|Document|Update|Table of contents> or
  <apply|menu|Document|Update|All> to generate the table of contents. You may
  have to do this several times, until the document does not change anymore.
  Indeed, the page numbers may change as a result of modifications in the
  table of contents!

  Some <apply|TeXmacs> typesetting primitives have no analogues in

  the following:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Left primes.

    <item>Big separators between big parentheses.

    <item>Mosaics.

    <item>Trees.

    <item>Vertical spaces ``before'' and ``after''.

    <item>Indentation flags ``before'' and ``after''.
  </itemize>

  You should avoid to use these specific <apply|TeXmacs> features, if your
  document needs to be converted into <apply|LaTeX>. Nevertheless, in the far
  future, the conversion program might generate encapsulated postscript by
  default of a more intelligible translation.

  <tmdoc-title|Graphical user interface related markup>

  The following markup elements can be used in order to describe various
  graphical user interface elements, such as keyboard shortcuts, menus or
  icons.

  <\explain|<markup|shortcut>>
    This macro is used to indicate a keyboard shortcut for a <scheme>
    command. For instance, the shortcut for <scm|(new-buffer)> is
    <shortcut|(new-buffer)>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<markup|key>>
    This unary macro is used for explicit keyboard input. For instance, when
    giving <rigid|<verbatim|A C-b return>> as argument, the result is <key|A
    C-b return>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<markup|menu>>
    This function with an arbitrary number of arguments indicates a menu like
    <menu|File> or <menu|Document|Language>. Menu entries are automatically
    translated by this function.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<markup|submenu>>
    Consider the following sentence:

    <\quote-env>
      ``You may use the <submenu|File|Load> and <submenu|File|Save> entries
      of the <menu|File> menu in order to load and save files.''
    </quote-env>

    In this example, the menu entries <submenu|File|Load> and
    <submenu|File|Save> were marked using the <markup|submenu> tag, which
    takes the implicit <menu|File> menu as its first invisible argument. This
    invisible argument is still taken into account when building the index
    (for instance). In a similar way, we provide <markup|subsubmenu> and
    <markup|subsubsubmenu> tags.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<markup|icon>>
    Can be used in order to specify one of the <TeXmacs> icons, such as
    <icon|tm_open.xpm> and <icon|tm_save.xpm>. The macro takes one argument
    with the file name of the icon (the full path is not needed).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<markup|screenshot>>
    Similar to the <markup|icon> tag, but for screenshots.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<markup|cursor>>
    This macro can be used to indicate a cursor position, as in
    <math|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2<cursor>>=c<rsup|2>>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<markup|small-focus>, <markup|small-envbox>>
    This macro can be used for indicating the visual aids around the current
    focus and the further outer context (<abbr|e.g.>
    <math|<small-envbox|a+<frac|b|<small-focus|c>>>>), in the case of inline
    elements.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<markup|big-focus>, <markup|big-envbox>>
    Block versions of <markup|small-focus> and <markup|small-envbox>.
  </explain>

  Notice that the contents of none of the above tags should be translated
  into foreign languages. Indeed, for menu tags, the translations are done
  automatically, so as to keep the translations synchronized with the
  translations of the actual <TeXmacs> menus. In the cases of markup, styles,
  packages and <abbr|d.t.d.>s, it is important to keep the original name,
  because it often corresponds to a file name.

  <tmdoc-title|Editing tools>

  In this chapter, we discuss the general editing facilities present in
  <TeXmacs>. Besides classical features, like ``cut and paste'', ``search and

  which exploits the document structure. Examples of such features are
  \ ``structured cursor movement'' and ``structured variants''. It should be
  noticed that more traditional functions like ``search and replace'' also
  attempt to exploit the structure. For instance, when searching <math|x> in
  math mode, you will only find matches which are also in math mode.

  <tmdoc-title|Functional operators>

  Functional operators are used for computational purposes during the
  typesetting phase, such as increasing counters, localizing strings like
  ``theorem'' and so on. A fundamental set of basic functional operators are
  built-in primitives. New functional operators can easily be added using the
  <markup|extern> primitive. Functional operators operate on five main types
  of arguments: strings, numbers, lengths, booleans and tuples. Some
  operators are overloaded, so that they can be used for several types.

  <tmdoc-title|Major objectives for the upcoming stable versions>

  Our main focus for the next stable version 1.1 (to be released during 2012)
  is on the improvement of the user interface and documentation. This
  comprises the following developments:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Completion and stabilization of the <name|Qt> port and the
    resulting ports for <name|Windows> and <name|MacOS>.

    <item>Development of a markup-based graphical user interface for popup
    windows. This new interface might only be ready after the next stable
    version 1.1.

    <item>Development of user-friendly tools for documentation and
    translations, which can be used in a collaborative version over the web.

    <item>Completion of a <TeXmacs> user manual and make it available in book
    form.
  </itemize>

  The next stable version 1.1 should also contain a more robust version of
  the graphical drawing tool, which is developed by Henri Lesourd. Finally,
  we plan to create an association for the proposition of free scientific
  software. One of the objectives of this association is to create a
  simplified system for making donations to <TeXmacs> and sell our software
  and documentation.

  Within a slightly longer time period of about one or two years, we have
  also started to reorganize <TeXmacs> so as to make it a stable development
  platform for developments. The aim is to reach as quickly as possible a
  point where the different parts of <TeXmacs> are well documented and
  modularized, so that they can easily be further developed in parallel by
  different people. Most of these deeper developments will reach their
  maturity only in the after-next stable version<nbsp>1.2, and comprise the
  following items:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Improve the quality of the <TeXmacs> makefiles so as to make them
    completely compatible with <verbatim|automake> and <verbatim|autoconf>.

    <item>Replace the current widget system by a markup-based system, with
    the possibility to use widgets (from Gtk, Qt, Aqua, etc.) from standard
    GUI's instead of the <TeXmacs>-provided style files.

    <item>Separate the style rewriting engine from the typesetter and make
    both completely lazy.

    <item>Increase the robustness and use of DRDs (Data Relation
    Definitions), which contain meta-information about <TeXmacs> or
    user-provided DTDs.

    <item>Migrate as much as possible of the high-level interface from C++ to
    <name|Scheme>.

    <item>Increase the robustness of <TeXmacs> and its <name|Scheme> APIs by
    providing detailed exception semantics and tools for debugging.

    <item>Provide extended documentation for developers and intelligent
    interactive ways to use this documentation.
  </itemize>

  <tmdoc-title|Using the theorem-like environments>

  The <tmdtd|env-theorem> <abbr|d.t.d.> contains the default theorem-like and
  other textual environments, which are available through
  <menu|Insert|Environment>. They are subdivided into three main categories:

  <\description>
    <item*|Variants of theorems>The bodies of theorem-like environments are
    usually emphasized. By default, the following such environments are
    available via <menu|Insert|Environment>: <markup|theorem>,
    <markup|proposition>, <markup|lemma>, <markup|corollary>, <markup|axiom>,
    <markup|definition>, <markup|notation>, <markup|conjecture>.

    <item*|Variants of remarks>The following ones are available via
    <menu|Insert|Environment>: <markup|remark>, <markup|example>,
    <markup|note>, <markup|warning>, <markup|convention>.

    <item*|Variants of exercises>Two such environments are provided by
    default and available via <menu|Insert|Environment>: <markup|exercise> and
    <markup|problem>.
  </description>

  The environments are all available in unnumbered versions
  <markup|theorem*>, <markup|proposition*>, <abbr|etc.> as well. You may use
  <shortcut|(numbered-toggle (focus-tree))> in order to switch between the unnumbered and numbered version.
  The following tags are also provided:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|proof|body>>
    For proofs of theorems.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|dueto|who>>
    An environment which can be used to specify the inventors of a theorem.
    It should be used at the start inside the body of a theorem, like in

    <\theorem*>
      <dueto|Pythagoras><with|mode|math|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>>.
    </theorem*>

  <tmdoc-title|Environment primitives>

  The current environment both defines all style parameters which affect the
  typesetting process and all additional macros provided by the user and the
  current style. The primitives in this section are used to access and modify
  environment variables.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|assign|var|val><explain-synopsis|variable mutation>
  <|explain>
    This primitive sets the environment variable named <src-arg|var> (string
    value) to the value of the <src-arg|val> expression. This primitive is
    used to make non-scoped changes to the environment, like defining markup
    or increasing counters.

    This primitive affects the evaluation process <emdash>through
    <markup|value>, <markup|provides>, and macro definitions<emdash> and the
    typesetting process <emdash>through special typesetter variables.

    <\example>
      Enabling page breaking by style.

      The <verbatim|page-medium> is used to enable page breaking. Since only
      the <re-index|initial environment> value for this variable is
      effective, this assignation must occur in a style file, not within a
      document.

      <\tm-fragment>
        <inactive*|<assign|page-medium|paper>>
      </tm-fragment>
    </example>

    <\example>
      Setting the chapter counter.

      The following snippet will cause the immediately following chapter to
      be number 3. This is useful to get the the numbering right in
      <verbatim|book> style when working with projects and <markup|include>.

      <\tm-fragment>
        <inactive*|<assign|chapter-nr|2>>
      </tm-fragment>
    </example>

    The operand must be a literal string and is interpreted as a file name.
    The content of this file is typeset in place of the <markup|include> tag,
    which must be placed in <re-index|block context>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|with|var-1|val-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|var-n|val-n|body><explain-synopsis|variable
    scope>
  <|explain>
    This primitive temporarily sets the environment variables <src-arg|var-1>
    until <src-arg|var-n> (in this order) to the evaluated values of
    <src-arg|val-1> until <src-arg|val-n> and typesets <src-arg|body> in this
    modified environment. All non-scoped change done with <markup|assign> to
    <src-arg|var-1> until <src-arg|var-n> within <src-arg|body> are reverted
    at the end of the <markup|with>.

    This primitive is used extensively in style files to modify the
    typesetter environment. For example to locally set the text font, the
    paragraph style, or the mode for mathematics.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|value|var><explain-synopsis|variable value>
  <|explain>
    This primitive evaluates the current value of the environment variable
    <src-var|var> (literal string). This is useful to display counters and
    generally to implement environment-sensitive behavior.

    This primitive is used extensively in style files to modify the
    typesetter environment. For example to locally set the text font, the
    paragraph style, or the mode for mathematics.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|provides|var><explain-synopsis|definition predicate>
  <|explain>
    This predicate evaluates to <verbatim|true> if the environment variable
    <src-var|var> (string value) is defined, and to <verbatim|false>
    otherwise.

    That is useful for modular markup, like the <markup|session>
    environments, to fall back to a default appearance when a required
    package is not used in the document.

  <tmdoc-title|Dialogs and composite widgets>

  <with|font-shape|italic|Dialogs> are collections of widgets arranged in a
  window in order to perform a common task. You might want to create one of
  this in order to configure or interact with a plugin: add some
  configuration options as well as some common actions and have the window
  always open besides your document. A good example whose code might help is
  the preferences dialog <scm|(open-preferences)>.

  In order to create more complex layouts than those we did before you'll
  need a few containers. Among these are <scm|aligned> and <scm|tabs>, which
  we explain below. A very useful macro which you'll be using often is
  <scm|dynamic>: it allows you to embed one widget into another.

  Let's see how you create a dialog. To get started here is one little
  example taken from <hlink|menu-test.scm|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/kernel/gui/menu-test.scm>:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (widget1)

      \ \ (centered

      \ \ \ \ (aligned

      \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "First:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (toggle (display* "First " answer "\\n") #f))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "Second:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (toggle (display* "Second " answer "\\n") #f)))))
    <|unfolded-io>
      \;
    </unfolded-io>
  </session>

  The keyword <scm|centered> is clear, just center whatever it contains, but
  <scm|aligned> not so much: it builds two column tables, with each row of
  type <scm|item>. As you can see, each <scm|item> takes two arguments, which
  can be of <with|font-shape|italic|any> type.

  The <scm|toggle> is another example of a widget which triggers a <scheme>
  command whenever it's clicked, or toggled in this case. The second argument
  stands for the default state of the <scm|toggle>.

  Again, in order to display this you create a <scm|top-window> and give it a
  title.

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|Scheme] >
      (top-window widget1 "Two toggle widgets")
    </input>
  </session>

  You'll notice that the created window is too small and the title is not
  wholly displayed. You can force it to be of a certain size using
  <scm|resize>:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (widget1)

      \ \ (centered

      \ \ \ \ (resize "500px" "200px"

      \ \ \ \ \ \ (aligned

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "First:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (toggle (display* "First " answer "\\n") #f))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "Second:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (toggle (display* "Second " answer "\\n") #f))))))
    <|unfolded-io>
      \;
    </unfolded-io>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      (top-window widget1 "A bigger window")
    </input>
  </session>

  <scm|resize> is another of the several available container or
  <hlink|content management widgets|scheme-gui-container.en.tm>. It accepts
  two sorts of arguments. Either one sets a fixed size for the widget with
  two strings, as in the example above, or one passes two lists, the first
  for widths, the second for heights, with the minimum, default and maximum
  values in that order, like this:\ 

  <scm|(resize ("100px" "200px" "400px") ("100px" "200px" "400px")
  (some-widget-here))>

  This sets <scm|some-widget-here> to have a default square size of 200x200
  pixels.

  If you want to add the usual buttons you use <scm|bottom-buttons> like in
  the following example. Notice that the widget now accepts one parameter
  <scm|cmd> which will be called when the user clicks the ``Ok'' button.

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (widget1-buttons cmd)

      \ \ (centered

      \ \ \ \ (aligned

      \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "First:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (toggle (display* "First " answer "\\n") #f))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "Second:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (toggle (display* "Second " answer "\\n") #f))))

      \ \ (bottom-buttons \<gtr\>\<gtr\> ("Ok" (cmd "Ok"))))
    <|unfolded-io>
      \;
    </unfolded-io>
  </session>

  Since the widget now needs an argument, we must use another function to
  display it, namely <scm|dialogue-window>, which will also close the window
  after the button has been clicked.

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|Scheme] >
      (dialogue-window widget1-buttons (lambda (arg) (display* arg "\\n"))
      "Two toggles")
    </input>
  </session>

  That special <scm|\<gtr\>\<gtr\>> at the end of the widget inserts as
  before whitespace, but it stretches and aligns the <scm|bottom-buttons> to
  the right. This is just another example of a <hlink|glue
  widget|scheme-gui-advanced.en.tm>.

  <subsection|Composite widgets>

  Note that our second dialog, <scm|widget1-buttons> is just a copy of
  <scm|widget1> with an extra line at the end. We could have spared us the
  keystrokes in this way:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (widget1-buttons-smarter cmd)

      \ \ (dynamic (widget1))

      \ \ (bottom-buttons \<gtr\>\<gtr\> ("Ok" (cmd "Ok"))))
    <|unfolded-io>
      \;
    </unfolded-io>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      (dialogue-window widget1-buttons-smarter (lambda (arg) (display* arg
      "\\n")) "Two toggles")
    </input>

    \;
  </session>

  As you can see, the approach we've shown has a shortcoming: there's no way
  to access all the values of the different widgets in your dialog at the
  same time. Of course you can use the function <scm|cmd> passed to your
  widget to perform some computations, but in case you need to retrieve or
  store complicated data, what you need is a form.

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-list|body>>
    This block environment is used to render the <src-arg|body> of the list.

    it.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|aligned-item|item-text>>
    This inline macro is used to render the <src-arg|item-text> in a
    right-aligned way. As a consequence, text after such items will appear in
    a left-aligned way.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|compact-item|item-text>>
    This inline macro is used to render the <src-arg|item-text> in a
    left-aligned way. As a consequence, text after such items may be indented
    by the width of the <src-arg|item-text> (except when the text is rendered
    on a different paragraph).

  <tmdoc-title|Notes for users of Cyrillic languages>

  In order to type Russian (and similarly for other Cyrillic languages) text,
  you have several options:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Select Russian as your default language in
    <menu|Edit|Preferences|Language|Russian>. If \ <TeXmacs> starts with
    Russian menus, then this is done automatically if the Russian locale is
    set.

    <item>Select Russian for an entire document using
    <menu|Document|Language|Russian>.

    <item>Select Russian for a portion of text in another document using
    <menu|Format|Language|Russian>.
  </itemize>

  If your X server uses the xkb extension, and is instructed to switch
  between the Latin and Russian keyboard modes, you need not do anything
  special. Just switch your keyboard to the Russian mode, and go ahead. All
  the software needed for this is included in modern Linux distributions, and
  the xkb extension is enabled by default in
  <with|font-family|tt|XF86Config>. With the xkb extension, keysyms are
  2-byte, and Russian letters are at 0x6??. The keyboard is configured by
  <with|font-family|tt|setxkbmap>. When X starts, it issues this command with
  the system-wide <with|font-family|tt|Xkbmap> file (usually living in
  <with|font-family|tt|/etc/X11/xinit>), if it exists; and then with the
  user's <with|font-family|tt|~/.Xkbmap>, if it exists. A typical
  <with|font-family|tt|~/.Xkbmap> may look like

  <verbatim| \ \ \ ru basic grp:shift_toggle>

  This means that the keyboard mode is toggled by <render-key|l-shift
  r-shift>. Other popular choices are <prefix|C-S-> or <prefix|A-C->, see
  <with|font-family|tt|/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/> for more details. This is the
  preferred keyboard setup for modern Linux systems, if you plan to use
  Russian often.

  In older Linux systems, the xkb extension is often disabled. Keysyms are
  1-byte, and are configured by <with|font-family|tt|xmodmap>. When X starts,
  it issues this command with the system-wide <with|font-family|tt|Xmodmap>
  (usually living in <with|font-family|tt|/etc/X11/xinit>), if it exists; and
  then with the user's <with|font-family|tt|~/.Xmodmap>, if it exists. You
  can configure the mode toggling key combination, and use a 1-byte Russian
  encoding (such as koi8-r) in the Russian mode. It is easier to download the
  package <with|font-family|tt|xruskb>, and just run

  <verbatim| \ \ \ xrus jcuken-koi8>

  at the beginning of your X session. This sets the layout jcuken (see below)
  and the encoding koi8-r for your keyboard in the Russian mode. If you use
  such keyboard setup, you should select Options
  <with|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>> international keyboard
  <with|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>> russian <with|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>>
  koi8-r.

  It is also possible to use the Windows cp1251 encoding instead of koi8-r,
  though this is rarely done in UNIX. If you do use <with|font-family|tt|xrus
  jcuken-cp1251>, select cp1251 instead of koi8-r.

  All the methods described above require some special actions to ``russify''
  the keyboard. This is not difficult, see the Cyrillic-HOWTO or, better, its
  updated version

  <verbatim|http://www.inp.nsk.su/<with|font-family|tt|~baldin/Cyrillic-HOWTO-russian/Cyrillic-HOWTO-russian.html>>

  Also, all of the above methods globally affect all X applications: text
  editors (emacs, nedit, kedit...), xterms, <TeXmacs> etc.

  If you need to type Russian only once, or very rarely, a proper keyboard
  setup may be more trouble than it's worth. For the benefit of such
  occasional users, <TeXmacs> has methods of Russian input which require no
  preliminary work. Naturally, such methods affect only <TeXmacs>, and no
  other application.

  The simplest way to type some Russian on the standard US-style keyboard
  with no software setup is to select <menu|Edit|Preferences|Keyboard|Cyrillic
  input method|translit>. Then, typing a Latin letter will produce ``the most
  similar'' Russian one. In order to get some Russian letters, you have to
  type 2- or 3-letter combinations:<vspace|0.5fn>

  If you want to get, e.g., ``<with|language|russian|font|cyrillic|>'', and
  not ``<with|language|russian|font|cyrillic|>'', you have to type <key|s /
  h>. Of course, the choice of ``optimal'' mapping of Latin letters to
  Russian ones in not unique. You can investigate the mapping supplied with
  <TeXmacs> and, if you don't like something, override it in your
  <with|font-family|tt|~/.TeXmacs/progs/my-init-texmacs.scm>.

  If you select jcuken instead of translit, you get the ``official'' Russian
  typewriter layout. It is so called because the keys ``qwerty'' produce
  ``<with|language|russian|<with|font|cyrillic|>''. This input method
  is most useful> when you have a Russian-made keyboard, which has additional
  Russian letters written on the key caps in red, in the jcuken layout (a
  similar effect can be achieved by attaching transparent stickers with red
  Russian letters to caps of a US-style keyboard). It is also useful if you
  are an experienced Russian typist, and your fingers remember this layout.

  Those who have no Russian letters indicated at the key caps often prefer
  the yawerty layout, where the keys ``qwerty'' produce
  ``<with|language|russian|font|cyrillic|''. Each Latin letter is
  mapped into a ``similar'' Russian one; some additional Russian letters are
  produced by ><prefix|S->-digits. <TeXmacs> comes with a slightly modified
  yawerty layout, because it does not redefine the keys <key|$>,
  <render-key|>, <key|\\>, which are important for <TeXmacs>, are not
  redefined. The corresponding Russian letters are produced by some
  <prefix|S->-digit combinations instead.

  <tmdoc-title|Introduction>

  There are three main kinds of objects for buffer management in <TeXmacs>:

  <\description>
    <item*|Buffers>Every open <TeXmacs> document is stored in a unique
    editable buffer. Buffers typically admit a<nbsp>one to one correspondence
    to files on disk or elsewhere on the web. Some buffers are of a<nbsp>more
    auxiliary nature, such as automatically generated help buffers. All
    buffers admit a unique URL. In the case of auxiliary buffers, this URL is
    really a read-only ``placeholder'', so saving this kind of buffers is
    impossible (of course, it remains possible to save the buffer under a new
    name).

    <item*|Views>It is possible to have multiple views on the same buffer.
    Every view is identified by a<nbsp>unique automatically generated URL,
    which again acts as a placeholder.

    <item*|Windows>Views (contrary to the buffers themselves) can be
    displayed in actual windows. Currently, any <TeXmacs> window contains a
    unique view and a view may only be displayed in one window at the same
    time (of course, it is possible to display different views on the same
    buffer in different windows). Windows are again represented by
    automatically generated<nbsp>URLS.
  </description>

  <\remark>
    In the future, views and windows should really be considered as documents
    themselves. Changes in the view will be automatically propagated (or not)
    to the corresponding buffer, and the other views. Windows will contain a
    document which specifies its layout (menus and toolbars). The
    corresponding view (or views) will be an active hyperlink (or active
    hyperlinks). The current APIs already reflect these future development
    intentions.

  <tmdoc-title|Inserting new objects>

  After insertion of a new picture or clicking inside an existing picture,
  the second mode dependent toolbar shows a<nbsp>list of icons which are
  useful in graphics mode. In particular, the second group of icons
  <icon|tm_point_mode.xpm>, <icon|tm_line_mode.xpm>,
  <icon|tm_cline_mode.xpm>, <icon|tm_spline_mode.xpm>,
  <icon|tm_cspline_mode.xpm>, <icon|tm_arc_mode.xpm>,
  <icon|tm_carc_mode.xpm>, <icon|tm_textat_mode.xpm>, <icon|tm_math.xpm> on
  this toolbar allows you to select the kind of objects that you want to
  insert. <TeXmacs> currently implements the following primitive graphical
  objects:

  <\description>
    <item*|Points>When selecting point mode using <icon|tm_point_mode.xpm> or
    <menu|Insert|Point>, you may insert simple points with the left mouse
    button.

    <item*|Lines and polygons>When selecting line mode using
    <icon|tm_line_mode.xpm> or <menu|Insert|Line>, you may insert a new
    broken line with the left mouse button: at every new click a new point is
    inserted and the last point is inserted using a double click. Polygon
    mode (<icon|tm_cline_mode.xpm> or <menu|Insert|Polygon>) is a variant of
    line mode, with this difference that an additional segment is inserted
    between the first and the last points.

    <item*|Splines and closed splines>Spline mode is selected using
    <icon|tm_spline_mode.xpm> or <menu|Insert|Spline>. This mode is similar
    to line mode, except that we now draw a smooth curve through the
    specified points. Again, this mode admits a closed variant
    (<icon|tm_cspline_mode.xpm> or <menu|Insert|Closed spline>).

    <item*|Arcs and circles>Arc mode is selected using <icon|tm_arc_mode.xpm>
    or <menu|Insert|Arc>. In this mode, you may insert arcs going through
    three points specified through left mouse clicks. Similarly, you may use
    circle mode (<icon|tm_carc_mode.xpm> or <menu|Insert|Circle>) for drawing
    circles.

    <item*|Text and mathematics>When selecting text mode
    (<icon|tm_textat_mode.xpm> or <menu|Insert|Text>) or mathematics mode
    (<icon|tm_math.xpm> or <menu|Insert|Mathematics>), you may enter text (or
    mathematics) at an arbitrary position in the picture, again using the
    left mouse button.
  </description>

  Typical examples of these basic objects are shown in the figures below:

  <tmdoc-title|Organization of style files and packages>

  Each standard <TeXmacs> style file or package is based on a potentially
  finite number of subpackages. From an abstract point of view, this
  organization may be represented by a labeled tree. For instance, the tree
  which corresponds to the <tmstyle|article> style is represented below:

  <\big-figure|<tree|<tmstyle|article>|<tree|<tmpackage|std>|<stack|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|std-markup>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|std-symbol>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|std-math>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|std-list>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|std-utils>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|std-counter>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|std-automatic>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|list>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|session>>>>>>>|<tree|<tmpackage|env>|<stack|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|env-base>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|env-math>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|env-theorem>>>|<row|<cell|<tmpackage|env-float>>>>>>>|<tree|<tmpackage|title-base>|<tmpackage|title-generic>>|<tmpackage|header-article>|<tree|<tmpackage|section-article>|<tmpackage|section-base>>>>
    The tree with the packages from which the <tmstyle|article> style has
    been built up. In order to save space, we have regrouped the numerous
    children of <tmpackage|std> and <tmpackage|env> in vertical lists.
  </big-figure>

  Most of the style packages correspond to a <abbr|d.t.d.> (data type
  definition) which contains the ``abstract interface'' of the package,
  <abbr|i.e.> the exported tags. For instance, the package
  <tmpackage|std-markup> corresponds to the <abbr|d.t.d.> <tmdtd|std-markup>.
  Sometimes however, several style packages match the same <abbr|d.t.d.>. For
  instance, both <tmpackage|header-article> and <tmpackage|header-book> match
  the <abbr|d.t.d.> <tmdtd|header>, since they merely implement different
  ways to render the same tags.

  When building your own style files or packages, you may use the
  <markup|use-package> primitive in order to include other packages. For
  instance, the <tmstyle|article> style essentially consists of the line

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<use-package|std|env|title-generic|header-article|section-article>>
  </tm-fragment>

  More precisely, the <markup|use-package> package sequentially includes the
  style packages corresponding to its arguments. The packages should be in
  <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PACKAGE_PATH>, which contains <verbatim|.>,
  <verbatim|~/.TeXmacs/packages> and <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/packages> by
  default. Furthermore rendering information for the source code like
  <markup|style-with> tags are discarded before evaluation of the files.

  <\remark>
    We strongly recommend the user to take a look at some of the standard
    style files and packages which can be found in

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/styles

      \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/packages
    </verbatim>

    When loading using <shortcut|(interactive load-buffer)>, these paths are in the standard load
    path. For instance, if you want to take a look at the
    <tmpackage|std-markup> package, then it suffices to type <shortcut|(interactive load-buffer)>,
    followed by the file name <verbatim|std-markup.ts> and
    <shortcut|(kbd-return)>.
  </remark>

  <\remark>
    It is also possible to customize the presentation of the source code of
    the style files and packages themselves, by using other packages in
    addition to <tmstyle|source> or by using another major style file based
    on <tmstyle|source>. In that case, the extra markup provided by such
    packages may be used for presentation purposes of the source code, but it
    is not exported when using your package in another file.

  <tmdoc-title|Keyboard configuration>

  The behaviour of keyboard inside <TeXmacs> depends on a few user
  preferences, as specified in the menu <menu|Edit|Preferences>:

  <\itemize>
    <item>The <hlink|<menu|Look and feel>|man-preferences.en.tm#preferences:look-and-feel>
    determines the main rules for keyboard shortcuts and attempts to make the
    behaviour as close as possible to the standards for the selected look and
    feel.

    <item>Some minor customizations are possible via
    <hlink|<menu|Edit|Preferences|Keyboard>|man-preferences.en.tm#preferences:keyboard>.
  </itemize>

  We will now detail specific issues related to the keyboard configuration on
  various systems.

  Please refer to the section on <hlink|general
  conventions|../start/man-conventions.en.tm> for explanations on the way
  keyboard shortcuts are printed in this manual. For more information on
  keyboard shortcuts, we refer to the general section on how the
  <hlink|master the keyboard|../text/keyboard/man-keyboard.en.tm>.

  <paragraph*|Standard conformance>

  <TeXmacs> attempts to be as standard-conformant regarding the various look
  and feels. However, there are a few general situations in which <TeXmacs>
  reserves some keyboard shortcuts for the sake of user-friendliness:

  <\itemize>
    <item>The function keys <key|F5>--<key|F12> are reserved for special
    actions.

    <item>Most standards admit a ``principal modifier key'' for forming
    keyboard shortcuts (<prefix|std><nbsp>for your look and feel) and
    sometimes another modifier key for other shortcuts (<abbr|e.g.> the
    <key|windows> key under <name|Windows> and <prefix|A-> under <name|Mac
    OS>). The remaining free modifier (<prefix|cmd> for your look and feel)
    is reserved for <TeXmacs>.

    <item><TeXmacs> contains many keyboard macros involving one or more
    modifier keys and the special keys <key|left>, <key|right>, <key|up>,
    <key|down>, <key|home>, <key|end>, <key|pageup>, <key|pagedown>,
    <key|backspace>, <key|delete>, <key|space>, <key|tab> and <key|return>.
    The behaviour of shortcuts of this kind is occasionally non standard.
  </itemize>

  <paragraph*|Potential conflicts>

  The <TeXmacs>-specific shortcuts are rarely in conflict with standard
  conventions. <space|0.2spc>Nevertheless, in
  table<nbsp><reference|kbd-conflict-table>, we have displayed some more or
  less standard shortcuts, which might work in other applications, but which
  will usually not work inside <TeXmacs>.

    <label|kbd-conflict-table>Some shortcuts that might work in other
    applications, but usually not in <TeXmacs>.
  </big-table>

  <paragraph*|System-wide shortcuts which may take precedence>

  In addition to the above standard shortcuts, some system-wide applications
  may define additional global shortcuts, which take precedence over the
  <TeXmacs> shortcuts. For instance, under <name|Mac OS X>, the application
  <name|Spaces> uses the shortcuts <key|C-left>, <key|C-right>, <key|C-up>,
  <key|C-down>, <key|C-1>, <key|C-2>, <key|C-3> and <key|C-4> to switch
  between multiple screens.

  One solution to the above problems is to change the problematic global
  shortcuts in the responsible applications. For instance, <name|Spaces> can
  be configured to use <prefix|M-A-C-> as a prefix instead of <prefix|C->
  (click on the popup menu behind ``To switch between spaces'' and
  simultaneously press <prefix|M->, <prefix|A-> and <prefix|C->). Notice that
  <prefix|fn> is another key which is not used by <TeXmacs>.

  If you cannot or do not want to change the system-wide shortcuts, then you
  may use the <rigid|<key*|escape>-key> in order to produce equivalents for
  the modifier keys <prefix|M->, <prefix|A-> and <prefix|C->. For instance,
  under <name|Mac OS>, <prefix|C-> is equivalent to <key*|escape escape>.
  Hence, the <TeXmacs> shortcut <key|C-right> can also be obtained by typing
  <key*|escape escape right>, which may coexist with the <name|Spaces>
  shortcut <key|C-right>. Table<nbsp><reference|kbd-escape-table> shows the
  modifier key combinations which can be obtained using <key*|escape>.

  <tmdoc-title|Special markup for sessions>

  The <tmdtd|session> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides the following environments for
  computer algebra sessions:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|session|body>>
    Environment for marking a session. All macros below are only for use
    inside sessions.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|input|prompt|body>>
    An input field with a <src-arg|prompt> and the actual input.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|output|body>>
    An output field.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|textput|body>>
    Fields with ordinary text. These may for instance be used for comments
    and explanations.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|errput|body>>
    This macro is used inside output fields for displaying error messages.
  </explain>

  In fact, these environments are based on environments of the form
  <markup|<em|lan>-session>, <markup|<em|lan>-input>,
  <markup|<em|lan>-output>, <markup|<em|lan>-textput> and
  <markup|<em|lan>-errput> for every individual language <markup|<em|lan>>.

  If language-specific environments do not exist, then
  <markup|generic-session>, <markup|generic-input>, <markup|generic-output>,
  <markup|generic-textput> and <markup|generic-errput> are taken instead. It
  is recommended to base the language-specific environments on the generic
  ones, which may have different implementations according to the style
  (<abbr|e.g.> the <tmstyle|framed-session> package). For this purpose, we also
  provide the <markup|generic-output*> environment, which is similar to
  <markup|generic-output>, except that margins remain unaltered.

  <tmdoc-title|Editing groups of objects>

  The rightmost series of icons on the second mode dependent toolbar is used
  for editing groups of graphical objects. In group editing mode, you may
  select or unselect objects using right mouse clicks. You may also select
  all objects in a rectangle by dragging using the right mouse button. When
  pressing the left mouse button, the current group operation is performed
  jointly on all selected objects.

  The following kinds of group operations are supported:

  <\description>
    <item*|Changing properties>Selected using <icon|tm_edit_props.xpm> or
    <menu|Insert|Set properties>. The current properties (as indicated in the
    focus bar) are applied to the selected objects.

    <item*|Move objects>Selected using <icon|tm_group_move.xpm> or
    <menu|Insert|Move objects>. The selected objects are moved until you
    press the left mouse button a second time.

    <item*|Resize objects>Selected using <icon|tm_group_zoom.xpm> or
    <menu|Insert|Resize objects>. The selected objects are resized until you
    press the left mouse button a second time.

    <item*|Rotate objects>Selected using <icon|tm_group_rotate.xpm> or
    <menu|Insert|Rotate objects>. The selected objects are rotated until you
    press the left mouse button a second time.

    <item*|Group or ungroup objects>Selected using <icon|tm_group_group.xpm>
    or <menu|Insert|Group/ungroup>. The selected objects are grouped together
    into a single object. If you selected one grouped object, then this
    object will be ungrouped.
  </description>

  In the group editing mode, it is also possible to copy and paste groups of
  objects.

  <tmdoc-title|Forms>

  As explained in ``<hlink|Dialogs and composite
  widgets|scheme-gui-dialogs.en.tm>'' the available widgets can be used to
  compose dialog windows which perform one simple task. But sometimes one
  needs to read complex input from the user and forms provide one mechanism
  to do this. They allow you to define multiple named fields of several
  types, whose values are stored in a hash table. The contents of this hash
  can be retrieved when the user clicks a button using the functions
  <scm|form-fields> and <scm|form-values>.

  In the following example you can see that the syntax is pretty much the
  same as for regular widgets, but you must prefix the keywords with
  <scm|form-> :

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\folded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (form3 cmd)

      \ \ (resize "500px" "500px"

      \ \ \ \ (padded

      \ \ \ \ \ \ (form "Test"

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (aligned

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "Input:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (form-input "fieldname1" "string" '("one")
      "1w"))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item === ===)

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "Enum:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (form-enum "fieldname2" '("one" "two" "three")
      "two" "1w"))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item === ===)

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "Choice:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (form-choice "fieldname3" '("one" "two"
      "three") "one"))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item === ===)

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (item (text "Choices:")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (form-choices "fieldname4"\ 

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ '("one" "two"
      "three")\ 

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ '("one" "two"))))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (bottom-buttons

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ("Cancel" (cmd "cancel")) \<gtr\>\<gtr\>

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ("Ok"

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (display* (form-fields) " -\<gtr\> "
      (form-values) "\\n")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (cmd "ok")))))))
    <|folded-io>
      \;
    </folded-io>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      (dialogue-window form3 (lambda (x) (display* x "\\n")) "Test of form3")

  A complete list of the widgets you can embed in a form is in the table

  <tmdoc-title|Why <TeXmacs> uses <value|scheme> as its extension language>

  At a first glance, the choice of <value|scheme> as an extension language
  for <TeXmacs> may seem a bit strange for people who are accustomed to more
  conventional programming languages, such as <name|C++>, <name|Java>
  or<nbsp><name|Python>. In particular, its heavy use of parenthesis
  frightens more than one person.

  Our choice of <value|scheme> has been motivated by the fact that the
  language is highly flexible in several<nbsp>ways:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>It is easy to mix programs and data in a common framework.

    <item>It is easy to customize the language itself, by adding new
    programming constructs.

    <item>It is easy to write programs on a very abstract level.
  </enumerate>

  The first two features are very particular important for extension
  languages. Indeed, one major use of extension languages is to store data
  for the application (like keyboard shortcuts and menus) in an intelligent
  way. Furthermore, the application usually provides some very typical
  features, which may need to be reflected at the level of the extension
  language.

  For the first two features, the simplicity of the parenthesized notation
  used by <value|scheme> \ is also an advantage. Indeed, consider the
  following fragment of the definition of the <menu|File> menu:

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (menu-bind file-menu

    \ \ ("New" (new-buffer))

    \ \ ("Load" (choose-file load-buffer "Load file" ""))

    \ \ ("Save" (save-buffer))

    \ \ ...)
  </scheme-fragment>

  The entries of the menu (the data) and the corresponding actions (the
  programs) are very readable using the bracket notation. Similarly, when
  defining a new language primitive, the systematic use of the bracket
  notation relieves the user from the burden of making the corresponding
  changes in the parser.

  <tmdoc-title|Standard utilities>

  In the <hyper-link|package <tmpackage|std-utils>|../../../main/styles/std/std-utils-dtd.en.tm>,
  the user may find several useful additional macros for writing style files.
  It mainly contains macros for

  <\itemize>
    <item>Writing block environments which span over the entire paragraph
    width. Notice that the <tmpackage|title-base> package provides some
    <hyper-link|additional macros|../../../main/styles/section/section-base-helper.en.tm>
    for wide section titles.

    <item>Writing wide block environments which are underlined, overlined or
    in a frame box.

    <item>Recursive indentation.

    <item>Setting page headers and footers.

    <item>Localization of text.
  </itemize>

  It is good practice to use these standard macros whenever possible when
  writing style files. Indeed, the low-level <TeXmacs> internals may be
  subject to minor changes. When building upon standard macros with a clear
  intention, you increase the upward compatibility of your style-sheets.

  elements which can be used for making slick presentations.

  Several types of remote controllers are supported for laptop presentations.
  Some of them (such as Apple infrared controllers) should work out of the
  box (at least for the Qt version). Others map the buttons on the remote
  controller to certain keys on your keyboard, and you will need to toggle
  <menu|View|Remote control> in order to remap these keys to the right
  actions during presentations. If necessary, the appropriate mappings may be
  specified in <menu|Edit|Preferences|Keyboard|Remote control>. By activating
  the debugging tool <menu|Tools|Debugging tool> and <menu|Debug|keyboard>,
  you may find out the particular mappings used by your remote control.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Designing your own style files>

  Whenever the standard <TeXmacs> style files are inadequate for a given
  purpose, it is possible to write your own style files. However, designing
  your own style file from scratch may be a complex task. For this reason, we
  recommend the reuse or customization of the standard <TeXmacs> style files
  and packages whenever possible. Consequently, it may be wise to read more
  about the <apply|hyper-link|customization|../customize/customize.en.tm> of
  the <TeXmacs> style files and packages first.

<style|tmdoc>

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Writing a simple style package>

  Let us explain on an example how to write a simple style package. First of
  all, you have to create a new buffer using <menu|File|New> and select the
  <tmstyle|source> document style using <menu|Document|Style|source>. Now
  save your empty style package in your personal style package directory

  <verbatim| \ \ \ $HOME/.TeXmacs/packages>

  Notice that the button <menu|Texts> in the file browser corresponds to the
  directory

  <verbatim| \ \ \ $HOME/.TeXmacs/texts>

  Consequently, you can go to the style package directory from there, by
  double clicking on <verbatim|..> and next on <verbatim|packages>.
  Similarly, the directory

  <verbatim| \ \ \ $HOME/.TeXmacs/styles>

  contains your personal style files. After saving your empty style package,
  it should automatically appear in the <menu|Document|Package> menu. Notice
  that style files must be saved using the <verbatim|.ts> file extension. If
  you save the style file in a subdirectory of
  <verbatim|$HOME/.TeXmacs/packages>, then it will automatically appear in
  the corresponding submenu of <menu|Document|Package>.

  Let us now create a simple macro <markup|hi> which displays ``Hello
  world''. First type <shortcut|(make 'assign)>, so as to create an assignment. You should
  see something like

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign||>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Now enter ``hi'' as the first argument and type <shortcut|(make 'macro)> inside the second
  argument in order to create a macro. You should now see something like

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hi|<macro|>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Finally, type the text ``Hello world'' in the body of the macro. Your
  document should now consist of the following line:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hi|<macro|Hello world>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  After saving your style package, opening a new document and selecting your
  package in the <menu|Document|Use package> menu, you may now use the macro
  <markup|hi> in your document by typing <key|\\ h i> and hitting
  <shortcut|(kbd-return)>.

  In a similar way, you may create macros with arguments. For instance,
  assume that we started entering a macro <markup|hello> in a similar way as
  above. Instead of typing ``Hello world'', we first type <shortcut|(structured-insert-left)>
  inside the macro body so as to create an additional argument on the left
  hand side of the cursor. We next enter the name of the argument, say
  ``name''. You should now see something like below:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hello|<macro|name|>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  In the second argument of the body, we now type ``Hello '', <shortcut|(make 'arg)>,
  ``name'', <key|right> and ``, how are you today?''. After this you
  should see

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hello|<macro|name|Hello <arg|name>, how are you
    today?>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <shortcut|(make 'arg)> shortcut is used to retrieve the macro argument
  <src-arg|name>. Instead of typing <shortcut|(make 'arg)>, ``name'' and
  <key|right>, you may also use the hybrid <key|\\>-key and type
  <key|\\ n a m e> followed by <shortcut|(kbd-return)>. After saving your style
  package, you may again use the macro in any document which uses your
  package by typing <key|\\ h e l l o> and hitting <key|return>.

  From the internal point of view, all macro definitions are stored in the
  environment of the <TeXmacs> typesetter. Besides macros, the environment
  also contains normal environment variables, such as section counters or the
  font size. The environment variables can either be globally changed using
  the <markup|assign> primitive, or locally, using the <markup|with>
  primitive. For instance, when including the line

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|section-nr|-1>>
  </tm-fragment>

  in your package, and using <tmstyle|article> as your major style, then the
  first section will be numbered <no-break><with|mode|math|0>. Similarly, the
  variant

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hello|<macro|name|Hello
    <with|font-shape|small-caps|<arg|name>>!>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  of the <markup|hello> macro displays the name of the person in
  <with|font-shape|small-caps|Small Capitals>. Notice that the <markup|with>
  primitive can also be used to locally redefine a macro. This is for
  instance used in the definitions of the standard list environments, where
  the macro which renders list icons is changed inside the body of the list.
  Yet another variant of the <markup|hello> macro relies on the standard
  <markup|person> macro:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hello|<macro|name|Hello <person|<arg|name>>!>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  In order to produce the macro application <inactive*|<person|<arg|name>>>,
  you first have to start a compound tag using <shortcut|(make 'compound)>, type the name
  ``person'', insert an argument <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)>, and enter the argument
  <src-arg|name> as before. When you are done, you may press
  <shortcut|(kbd-return)> in order to change the <markup|compound> tag into a
  <markup|person> tag. Alternatively, you may type <key|\\>, ``person'',
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)> and ``name''.

  By combining the above constructs, an ordinary user should already be able
  to produce style packages for all frequently used notations. An interesting
  technique for writing macros which involve complex formulas with some
  subformulas which may change goes as follows:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>Type the formula, say <with|mode|math|(a<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,a<rsub|n>)>,
    in an ordinary document.

    <item>Create the skeleton of your macro in your style package:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|n-tuple|<macro|a|>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    <item>Copy the formula and paste it into the body of your macro:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|n-tuple|<macro|a|(a<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,a<rsub|n>)>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    <item>Replace the subformulas you want to parameterize by macro
    arguments:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|n-tuple|<macro|a|(<arg|a><rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,<arg|a><rsub|n>)>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    <item>You may now use the macro in documents which use your package:

    <\equation*>
      <with|n-tuple|<macro|a|(<arg|a><rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,<arg|a><rsub|n>)>|<n-tuple|a>=<n-tuple|b>.>
    </equation*>
  </enumerate>

  <tmdoc-title|General principles for customization>

  Style files and packages basically enrich the current typesetting
  environment with a combination of

  <\itemize>
    <item>Environment variables.

    <item>Tags for the end-user.

    <item>Customizable macros.
  </itemize>

  Furthermore, they may define some tags for intern implementation purposes,
  which will not be documented in this manual. They may also specify some
  logical properties of tags using the <markup|drd-props> primitive.

  Environment variables are almost always attributes for controlling the
  rendering of content, or counters for sections, equations, <abbr|etc.>.
  Although several simple tags for the end-user like <markup|strong> may be
  redefined in your own style files, this practice is not recommended for
  more complex tags like <markup|section>. Indeed, the <markup|section> tag
  involves many things like resetting subcounters, entering the title into
  the table of contents and so on. Therefore, special additional macros are
  provided the customization of such tags, like <markup|section-title>,
  <markup|section-clean> and <markup|section-toc>.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Introduction to the <name|Guile> extension language>

  Like <name|Emacs>, <apply|TeXmacs> comes with a <name|Lisp>-like extension
  language, namely the <with|font shape|small-caps|Guile Scheme> dialect from
  the <with|font shape|small-caps|GNU> project. For documentation about
  <with|font shape|small-caps|Guile Scheme>, we refer to\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html
  </verbatim>

  <apply|scheme> has the advantage that it may be extended with extern C and
  C++ types and routines. In our case, we have extended <apply|scheme> with
  routines which you can use to create your own menus and key-combinations,
  and even to write your own extensions to <apply|TeXmacs>.

  If you have downloaded the source files of <apply|TeXmacs>, then it may be
  interesting for you to take a look at the files\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ Guile/Glue/build-glue-basic.scm<format|next line>
    \ \ Guile/Glue/build-glue-editor.scm<format|next line>
    \ \ Guile/Glue/build-glue-server.scm
  </verbatim>

  These three ``glue'' files contain the C++ routines, which are visible
  within <apply|scheme>. In what follows, we will discuss some of the most
  important routines. We plan to write a more complete reference guide later.
  You may also take a look at the scheme <verbatim|.scm> files in the
  directory <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs>.

  <tmdoc-title|Plug-ins as scripting languages>

  <TeXmacs> provides a few other kinds of additional interfaces to external
  systems in addition to shell-like interfaces. First of all, it is possible
  to insert a so called ``executable switch'' anywhere in the document using
  <menu|Insert|Fold|Executable>.

  For instance, if <name|Maxima> is installed on your system, then
  <menu|Insert|Fold|Executable|Maxima> should yield something like
  <script-input|maxima|default||>. You may enter a<nbsp><name|Maxima>
  expression in the yellow part of this markup, say
  <script-input|maxima|default|diff(x^x,x)|>. Using <shortcut|(kbd-return)>,
  you may now switch back and forth between the unevaluated input and the
  evaluated output <script-output|maxima|default|diff(x^x,x)|<math|x<rsup|x>*<around*|(|log
  <around*|(|x|)>+1|)>>>. Using <shortcut|(kbd-shift-return)>, you enable
  multi-line input. This kind of executable switches are very useful for
  plug-ins such as <name|Dra<TeX>>, <name|Eukleides>, <name|Feynmf>,
  <abbr|etc.>, which are mainly used for the efficient computation and
  insertion of special graphics inside <TeXmacs> documents.

  Some plug-ins such as <name|Maxima> can even be selected as a <em|scripting
  language> using <menu|Document|Scripts|Maxima>. When doing so, a special
  <menu|Maxima> menu will appear, which allows for many useful operations
  directly on formulas. For instance, when putting the cursor inside the
  formula <math|1+1> and pressing <shortcut|(script-eval)> or
  <menu|Evaluate>, the formula gets evaluated automatically to yield
  <math|2>.

  If a plug-in can be used as a scripting language, then it is possible to
  create executable switches with links between them. More precisely,
  assuming that you selected a scripting language from
  <menu|Document|Scripts>, you may insert a new <em|executable input field>
  using <shortcut|(make-calc-input)> or <menu|Insert|Link|Executable input
  field>. As before, when pressing <key|return>, the current input is
  evaluated and you will see the corresponding output; you may switch back to
  the input by pressing <key|return> once more.

  Contrary to executable switches, you may attach an identifier to the
  executable input field by disactivating the field or by editing the
  <samp|Ref> field in the focus bar. Inside other executable input fields,
  you may then refer to the value of the field by inserting a <em|field
  reference> using <shortcut|(make 'calc-ref)> or <menu|Insert|Link|Field
  reference>. As a variant to executable input fields, you may sometimes
  prefer to insert plain <em|input fields> using <shortcut|(make-calc-inert)>
  or <menu|Insert|Link|Input field>. These fields can only be used as inputs
  and pressing <key|return> inside such a field will only recompute those
  other fields which depend on it.

  <\example>
    The excutable input fields may for instance be nice in pedagogic
    documents in which parts of the document may be modified and recomputed
    by the reader. For instance, evaluation of the input fragment

    <\quote-env>
      The derivative of <with|prog-scripts|maxima|<calc-inert|function|<math|x<rsup|x>>>>
      equals <with|prog-scripts|maxima|<calc-input|derivative|diff(<calc-ref|function>,x)|<math|x<rsup|x>*<around*|(|log
      <around*|(|x|)>+1|)>>>>.

      The second derivative is given by <with|prog-scripts|maxima|<calc-input|second|diff(<calc-ref|derivative>,x)|<math|x<rsup|x>*<around*|(|log
      <around*|(|x|)>+1|)><rsup|2>+x<rsup|x-1>>>>.
    </quote-env>

    yields

    <\quote-env>
      The derivative of <with|prog-scripts|maxima|<calc-inert|function2|<math|x<rsup|x>>>>
      equals <with|prog-scripts|maxima|<calc-output|derivative2|diff(<calc-ref|function2>,x)|<math|x<rsup|x>*<around*|(|log
      <around*|(|x|)>+1|)>>>>.

      The second derivative is given by <with|prog-scripts|maxima|<calc-output|second2|diff(<calc-ref|derivative2>,x)|<math|x<rsup|x>*<around*|(|log
      <around*|(|x|)>+1|)><rsup|2>+x<rsup|x-1>>>>.
    </quote-env>

    Of course, if the reader changes the input function <math|x<rsup|x>> into
    something else and presses <key|return>, then the first and second
    derivatives will be updated automatically.

  <tmdoc-title|Other things we are working on>

  Even though our main focus is on the stabilization of <TeXmacs> and to make

  development on new features. A few points currently have our priority:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Further development of the graphical drawing mode. Our main next
    goal is to allows users to create new macros, either by explicit
    constructions or constrained-based constructions. Finally, we would like
    to incorporate several features which are typically found in editors of
    vector graphics, such as <hlink|<name|Inkscape>|http://www.inkscape.org/>.

    <item>Extended features for computer algebra sessions, such as automatic
    folding of large expressions, lazy output (with subexpressions which can
    be further evaluated by clicking on them), cas-aided writing, etc.

    <item>Continue the development of remote <TeXmacs> servers for providing
    web-based services in combination with <TeXmacs>. These services comprise
    chatting (with mathematical formulas) and collaborative authoring.

    <item>Development of universal spreadsheet tools, which can be connected
    to any external plug-in for doing the computations. In a similar vein,
    external plug-ins might be used to draw graphs of functions in the
    graphical mode.

  <tmdoc-title|An introduction to widgets>

  In <TeXmacs> you create and extend the visual interface using <em|widgets>.
  This word means either the basic building blocks you have at your disposal,
  like buttons, popup lists, etc. or the collections of those into dialogs,
  menu bars or whatever. This rather loose concept might be confusing,
  especially when we refer to what usually are know as dialogs as widgets,
  but it makes sense because all sorts of widgets can be aggregated to build
  more complicated ones as well.<\footnote>
    If you miss some particular ``building block'' from your OS, you might
    see whether it's feasible as an aggregation of simpler ones or try and
    play with the UI interface code in C++ (but you'll have to add it for
    every supported platform!).
  </footnote>

  However, it must be kept in mind that items intended to be inserted in a
  menu bar won't necessarily display as they do in a separate window:
  complicated aggregations of widgets might be better placed in a separate
  window or dialogue, as explained in "<hlink|Dialogs and composite
  widgets|scheme-gui-dialogs.en.tm>".

  A complete reference with all the available widgets is the "<hlink|Widgets
  reference guide|scheme-gui-reference.en.tm>", and you can find some
  examples in the other subsections of "<hlink|Extending the graphical user
  interface|scheme-gui.en.tm>". If you'd rather see the sources, the whole
  list of keywords is in the table <scm|gui-make-table> inside
  <hlink|menu-define.scm|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/kernel/gui/menu-define.scm>.

  To create a widget, you'll first need to use <scm|tm-widget> to define a
  new one. The call to this function uses its particular syntax, with many
  keywords for the creation of widgets. But we'll start with some buttons and
  labels.\ 

  Execute the following two lines to get the unavoidable example and leave
  your mouse over the ``Hello'' button.

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (example1) ("Hello" "world!"))
    </input>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      (top-window example1 "A first try")
    </input>
  </session>

  As you can see, buttons are implicitly created by simply writing a list
  with the button's title and a tooltip to be displayed when the user hovers
  over the button. A bit confusing, and also ugly, because this is intended
  for <with|font-shape|italic|toolbar> buttons. What you probably want is
  this:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (example2) (explicit-buttons ("Hello" (noop))))
    </input>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      (top-window example2 "A nicer button")
    </input>
  </session>

  The second argument is now a <scheme> command to be executed when the user
  clicks the button, in this case a no-operation, or <scm|(noop)>. Try
  changing it for <scm|(display "World")> or anything that suits you.

  The next step is to add some text next to the button, i.e. a label. This is
  done with the <scm|text> keyword, as in <scm|(text "Hello")>, but in order
  to have both widgets sit side by side, you'll need a container widget as
  described in "<hlink|Containers, glue, refresh and
  co.|scheme-gui-advanced.en.tm>", such as <scm|hlist>:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (example3)

      \ \ (hlist\ 

      \ \ \ \ (text "Hello")\ 

      \ \ \ \ (explicit-buttons ("world" (display "!\\n")))))
    <|unfolded-io>
      \;
    </unfolded-io>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      (top-window example3 "Some text")
    </input>
  </session>

  That was nice, but as you see, the two widgets are packed together until
  you resize the window. We need to explicitly tell <TeXmacs> to insert some
  space between them:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (example3)

      \ \ (hlist\ 

      \ \ \ \ (text "Hello")

      \ \ \ \ \<gtr\>\<gtr\>\<gtr\>

      \ \ \ \ (explicit-buttons ("world" (display "!\\n")))))
    <|unfolded-io>
      \;
    </unfolded-io>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      (top-window example3 "Some text")
    </input>
  </session>

  The special symbol <scm|\<gtr\>\<gtr\>\<gtr\>> is just one of the
  predefined glue widgets described in "<hlink|Containers, glue, refresh and
  co.|scheme-gui-advanced.en.tm>".

  Text attributes may be changed for <scm|text> widgets and many others by
  enclosing them inside what we'll name <with|font-shape|italic|style
  widgets>. These attributes are <scm|mini>, <scm|monospaced>, <scm|grey>,
  <scm|inert>, <scm|centered> and <scm|bold>, and respectively: reduce the
  size of the widget, choose a <tt|monospaced font>, set the color to
  <with|color|grey|grey>, deactivate the widget (meaning it is rendered, but
  greyed out and inactive), center it and choose a bold face. Here is an
  example:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
      (tm-widget (example3)

      \ \ (hlist\ 

      \ \ \ \ (bold (text "Hello"))

      \ \ \ \ \<gtr\>\<gtr\>\<gtr\>

      \ \ \ \ (inert (explicit-buttons ("world" (display "!\\n"))))))
    <|unfolded-io>
      \;
    </unfolded-io>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      (top-window example3 "Some text")
    </input>
  </session>

  From here you can go on reading ``<hlink|Extending the graphical user
  interface|scheme-gui.en.tm>'' or see the sample widgets in
  <hlink|menu-test.scm|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/kernel/gui/menu-test.scm>.

  <tmdoc-title|Explanations of macros, environment variables, and so on>

  The main environment which is used for explanations of macros, environment
  variables, <scheme> functions, <abbr|etc.> is inserted using the
  <subsubmenu|Manual|Explain|Explanatory item> entry of the
  <menu|Manual|Explain> and <icon|tm_explain.xpm> menus. The environment
  comes with two arguments: the first argument consists of the concept or
  concepts to be explained, and the second one contains the actual
  explanation. A typical example would be the following:

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|demo-tag|body>

    <explain-macro|demo-tag|extras|body><explain-synopsis|short and long
    versions of a demo tag>
  <|explain>
    The <markup|demo-tag> is used for demonstration purposes and decorates
    the <src-arg|body><compound|src-var|> argument. An optional argument
    <src-arg|extras> can be given with details on the way to decorate the
    <src-arg|body>.
  </explain>

  In this example, we used <menu|Manual|Explain|TeXmacs macros> twice in
  order to insert the macros to be described. We also used
  <menu|Manual|Explain|Synopsis> in order to give a short description of the
  tags (in grey). In a similar way, one may use
  <menu|Manual|Explain|Environment variable> in order to describe an
  environment variable. Another example is:

  <\explain>
    <scm|(foo-bar <scm-arg|K> <scm-arg|x>)>
  <|explain>
    The function <scm|foo-bar> computes the foo-bar transform of the operator
    <scm|<scm-arg|K>> and applies it to <scm|<scm-arg|x>>.
  </explain>

  In this example, we notice that all <scheme> code was encapsulated into
  <markup|scm> tags (see <menu|Insert|Program|Inline code|Scheme>) and
  arguments were tagged using <markup|scm-arg>.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|<TeXmacs> style files>

  One of the fundamental strengths of <TeXmacs> is the possibility to write
  your own style files and packages. The purpose of style files is multiple:

  <\itemize>
    <item>They allow the abstraction of repetitive elements in texts, like
    sections, theorems, enumerations, etc.

    <item>They form a mechanism which allow you to structure your text. For
    instance, you may indicate that a given portion of your text is an
    abbreviation, a quotation or ``important''.

    <item>Standard document styles enable you to write professionally looking
    documents, because the corresponding style files have been written with a
    lot of care by people who know a lot about typography and aesthetics.
  </itemize>

  To a document, it is possible to associate one or several document styles,
  which are either standard or user defined. The main document style of a
  document is selected in the <apply|menu|Document|Style> menu. Extra styles
  can be added using <apply|menu|Document|Use package>.

  From the editor point of view, each style corresponds to a <verbatim|.ts>
  file. The files corresponding to each style are processed in as if they
  were usual documents, but at the end, the editor only keeps the final
  environment as the initial environment for the main document. More
  precisely, the style files are processed in order as well as there own
  styles, in a recursive manner.

  <tmdoc-title|Positioning and resizing objects>

  The <prefix|structured:geometry> prefix may be used for positioning and
  resizing objects. For instance, inside a cell of a<nbsp>table, you may use
  <key|structured:geometry right> to align the cell more to the right. Behind
  a space introduced <em|via> <menu|Format|Space>, the same key allows you to
  increase the width of space. More generally, the following shortcuts are
  implemented:

  <\description>
    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-left)>>Decrease the horizontal size of an
    object, or align more to the left.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-right)>>Increase the horizontal size of an
    object, or align more to the right.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-down)>>Decrease/increase the vertical size of
    an object, or align more to the bottom.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-up)>>Increase/decrease the vertical size of an
    object, or align more to the top.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-start)>>Decrease the horizontal offset of an
    object, or left align.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-end)>>Increase the horizontal offset of an
    object, or right align.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-bottom)>>Decrease the vertical offset of an
    object, or align at the bottom.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-top)>>Increase the vertical offset of an
    object, or align at the top.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-reset)>>Revert the geometry (size, position,
    alignment) to the defaults.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-circulate #t)>, <shortcut|(geometry-circulate
    #f)>>Circulate among available length units for specifying the geometry.

    <item*|<shortcut|(geometry-slower)>, <shortcut|(geometry-faster)>>Decrease
    or increase the step size when positioning or resizing.
  </description>

  Particular tags to which the shortcuts apply are the following

  <\description>
    <item*|Spaces>Both horizontal and vertical spaces from the
    <menu|Format|Space> menu. You should put the cursor just after the space
    tag for the shortcuts to apply.

    <item*|Box modifiers>The tags <markup|move>, <markup|shift>,
    <markup|resize>, <markup|extend>, <markup|clipped>, <markup|smashed>,
    <markup|swell> from the <menu|Format|Adjust> menu.

    <item*|Animations>The durations of animations can be modified using
    <shortcut|(geometry-left)> and <shortcut|(geometry-right)>.

    <item*|Images>The size and alignment of images can be changed.

  <tmdoc-title|Indexation>

  The purpose of the first extension of the basic database API is to permit
  searching for certain keywords in the database entries. The current
  implementation achieves this by maintaining a<nbsp>few additional tables
  with the list of entries in which given keywords occur. We also maintain
  a<nbsp>few additional prefix tables which allow us to search for
  uncompleted keywords. For efficiency reasons, the indexation is done at a
  low level in C++.

  It should be noticed that the indexation mechanism only indexates
  alphanumerical keywords and normalizes all keywords to lowercase. Accented
  characters and characters in other (<abbr|e.g.><nbsp>cyrillic) scripts are
  also ``transliterated'' into basic unaccented roman characters. For
  instance, we write ``'' and ``\<#449\>'' as ``e'' and ``shch''. As a
  consequence, a search for ``poincare'' will match ``Poincar''.

  <paragraph|Macros for context specification>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(with-indexing method . body)><explain-synopsis|enable indexation>
  <|explain>
    Specify the indexing method used within the <scm|body>. Currently, the
    <scm|method> can be either <scm|#f> (no indexation), <scm|:basic> (basic
    indexation of the most important fields only) and <scm|#t> (systematic
    indexation of all fields).
  </explain>

  <paragraph|Affected routines of the database API>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-set-field id attr vals)><explain-synopsis|set values for a given
    field>

    <scm|(db-set-entry id l)><explain-synopsis|fill out a complete entry>

    <scm|(db-remove-entry id)><explain-synopsis|remove a complete entry>
  <|explain>
    The default behaviour is extended so as to maintain the indexation
    tables.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(db-search q)><explain-synopsis|search for a list of fields>
  <|explain>
    Two types of supplementary constraints are introduced: <scm|(:match
    keyword)> and <scm|(:prefix keyword)>. The first constraint only returns
    entries for which <scm|keyword> occurs in one of the indexed fields. In
    the second case, the <scm|keyword> may also occur as a prefix of a
    keyword in one of the indexed fields.
  </explain>

  <paragraph|Other useful routines>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(index-do-indexate? attr)><explain-synopsis|test whether to indexate
    attribute>
  <|explain>
    Tests whether to indexate fields for the specified attribute <scm|attr>
    when using the <scm|:basic> indexing method. The test is done by looking
    up values in the smart table <scm|index-attribute-table>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(index-get-completions prefix)><explain-synopsis|get possible
    completions of a prefix>
  <|explain>
    Get the list of all possible completions of a <scm|prefix> into a keyword
    which has been indexated.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(index-get-name-completions prefix)><explain-synopsis|name field
    completions of a prefix>
  <|explain>
    Get the list of all names of fields which admit <scm|prefix> as a prefix.
    Contrary to the other indexation routines, the completions are not
    necessarily alphanumerical keywords, and case matters. This routine is
    for instance useful for the tab-completion of names of bibliographic
    entries.

  <tmdoc-title|Box operation primitives>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|move|content|delta-x|delta-y><explain-synopsis|adjust
    position>
  <|explain>
    This primitive moves the box with the specified <src-arg|content> by
    <src-arg|delta-x> to the right and <rigid|<src-arg|delta-y>> upwards. It
    may be used for fine-grained positioning. During the evaluation of
    <src-arg|delta-x> and <src-arg|delta-y>, the <hlink|box
    lengths|../basics/lengths.en.tm#box-lengths> <verbatim|w>, <verbatim|h>,
    <verbatim|l>, <verbatim|r>, <verbatim|b> and <verbatim|t> of
    <src-arg|content> are defined.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|shift|content|delta-x|delta-y><explain-synopsis|shift
    contents, not the bounding box>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is similar to <markup|move>, except that the bounding box
    of the shifted <src-arg|content> is the same as the bounding box of the
    original <src-arg|content>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|resize|content|left-lim|bot-lim|right-lim|top-lim><explain-synopsis|adjust
    size>
  <|explain>
    Resize the box for the <src-arg|content> according to new left, bottom,
    right and top limits <src-arg|left-lim>, <src-arg|bot-lim>,
    <src-arg|right-lim> and <src-arg|top-lim>. The limits may be specified in
    terms of the <hlink|box lengths|../basics/lengths.en.tm#box-lengths>
    <verbatim|w>, <verbatim|h>, <verbatim|l>, <verbatim|r>, <verbatim|b> and
    <verbatim|t> of <src-arg|content>. For instance, the code

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|(<resize|Hopsa|<minus|1l|5mm>||<plus|1r|5mm>|>)>
    </tm-fragment>

    widens the box for ``Hopsa'' by <verbatim|5mm> on each side:

    <\tm-fragment>
      (<resize|Hopsa|<minus|1l|5mm>||<plus|1r|5mm>|>)
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|clipped|content|left-lim|bot-lim|right-lim|top-lim><explain-synopsis|adjust
    size and clip>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is similar to <markup|resize>, except that the
    <src-arg|content> is clipped so as to fit in the specified new bounding
    box.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|if*|condition|content><explain-synopsis|conditional
    appearance of box>
  <|explain>
    The box with the <src-arg|content> is displayed as usual if the
    <src-arg|condition> is satisfied and displayed as whitespace otherwise.
    This primitive is used in particular for the definition of the
    <markup|phantom> macro. For instance, the non-text
    ``<if*|false|phantom>'' is produced using
    <inactive*|<if*|false|phantom>>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|repeat|content|pattern><explain-synopsis|fill line>
  <|explain>
    This primitive can be used to decorate some <src-arg|content> with a
    given <src-arg|pattern>. For instance, when defining the macro

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|wipe-out|<macro|x|<repeat|<arg|x>|<with|color|red|/>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    the code <inactive*|<wipe-out|obsolete>> produces
    <with|wipe-out|<macro|x|<repeat|<arg|x>|<with|color|red|/>>>|<wipe-out|obsolete>>.
    The <markup|repeat> primitive may also be used to fill the current line
    with a given content, like the dots in tables of
    contents.<repeat|<htab|5mm>|...>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|datoms|foo|content>

    <explain-macro|dlines|foo|content>

    <explain-macro|dpages|foo|content><explain-synopsis|decorations>
  <|explain>
    These primitives are used to decorate <em|a posteriori> the lines of a
    paragraph, the lines of a page, or the pages of a document. Currently,
    only decorations of atoms on lines of a paragraph have been implemented.

    The first argument <src-arg|foo> is a macro which will be applied to all
    boxes in the line and the second argument <src-arg|content> is the part
    of the paragraph to which the decoration will be applied. For instance,
    the construction

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<style-with|src-compact|none|<datoms|<macro|x|<active*|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<arg|x>>>>>>>>|<arg|body>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    may be used in order to visualize the boxes in a given paragraph:

    <\quote-env>
      <datoms|<macro|x|<active*|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<arg|x>>>>>>>>|Here
      is a sufficiently long paragraph. Here is a sufficiently long
      paragraph. Here is a sufficiently long paragraph. Here is a
      sufficiently long paragraph. Here is a sufficiently long paragraph.
      Here is a sufficiently long paragraph.>
    </quote-env>

    When used in combination with the <markup|repeat> primitive, one may for
    instance produce the dotted lines in tables of contents using the macro

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<style-with|src-compact|none|<assign|toc-dots|<macro|<style-with|src-compact|none|<datoms|<macro|x|<repeat|<arg|x>|<space|0.2fn>.<space|0.2fn>>>|<htab|5mm>>>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    Notice that the <markup|datoms> primitive is quite fragile, because the
    <src-arg|foo> macro has no access to the environment in which
    <src-arg|content> is typeset.

  <tmdoc-title|Traversal of a presentation>

  One major family of markup tags for presentations concerns the traversal of
  the document during a presentation. The keys <key|F10> and <key|F11> are
  used respectively for going back and forth in the presentation. The keys
  <key|F9> and <key|F12> are used to go to the start <abbr|resp.> end of the
  presentation. When using the <tmstyle|beamer> style or when enabling the
  ``presentation tool'' in the <menu|Tools> menu, a <menu|Dynamic> menu and
  additional icons will appear, which can also be used for the traversal of
  your presentation.

  The most basic traversal tag is called a ``switch'', and allows the user to
  show different pieces of text in successive and mutually exclusive manner.
  The entire presentation itself usually consists of a <markup|screens>
  switch, where the pieces are the successive ``slides'' of the presentation.
  After selection of the <tmstyle|beamer> style, this switch can be inserted
  using <menu|Focus|Screens> or <menu|Insert|Fold|Switch|Screens>. You may
  jump from one screen to another one using <key|pageup> and <key|pagedown>.

  Inside a switch, new ``branches'' can be inserted after or before the
  currently visible branch using <menu|Focus|Insert argument after> or
  <menu|Focus|Insert argument before>. Besides the <markup|screens> switch,
  you may use <menu|Insert|Fold|Switch|Standard> to insert paragraph-wide
  switches, and <menu|Insert|Fold|Switch|Standard> to insert inline switches
  (similarly to displayed and inline formulas).

  Another popular way to traverse is presentation is to progressively unroll
  content. This can be done by inserting an <markup|unroll> tag using
  <menu|Insert|Fold|Unroll>. Using a ``hack'' this tag can be combined with
  the <markup|itemize> and <markup|enumerate> tags: first create the list
  environment, but remove the first (automatically inserted) <markup|item>
  tag. Next insert the unroll tag. When pressing <key|enter> inside the
  unroll tag, new items are created; you still have to use <menu|Focus|Insert
  argument after> for inserting new branches to the unroll structure (in
  particular, several items could be unrolled at once).

  A variant of unrolling is unfolding. This is basically an unroll tag with
  exactly two branches, but different variants are available in
  <menu|Insert|Fold|Folded> depending on the desired rendering. In
  particular, some of the renderings display a button which may be pushed in
  order to fold or unfold some content. The input-output fields inside
  computer algebra sessions are also foldable. Similarly, the tags in
  <menu|Insert|Fold|Summarize> are switches with two branches, again with
  different kinds of rendering.

  When using <TeXmacs> in combination with an external plug-in, such as a
  computer algebra system, you will notice that all input-output fields in
  <hlink|sessions|../interface/man-session-basic.en.tm> are foldable. In
  addition, you can create so called ``<hlink|executable
  switches|../interface/man-scripting-language.en.tm>'' using the items in
  the <menu|Insert|Fold|Executable> submenu. This allows you to switch back
  and forth between a given input to the system and the corresponding output.

  All markup for the traversal of presentations may be nested in a natural
  way. In the <menu|Insert|Fold|Traversal> menu, you may specify whether
  unrolled and folded structures should be folded back after traversal.

  <tmdoc-title|<value|scheme> serialization>

  Users may write their own extensions to <TeXmacs> in the <value|scheme>
  extension language. In that context, <TeXmacs> trees are usually
  represented by <value|scheme> expressions. The <value|scheme> syntax was
  designed to be predictable, easy to hand-edit, and expose the complete
  internal structure of the document. For instance, the formula
  (<reference|tm-tree-ex>) is represented by

  <\tm-fragment>
    <verbatim|(with "mode" "math" (concat "x+y+" (frac "1" "2") "+" (sqrt
    "y+z")))>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <value|scheme> representation may also be useful in order to represent
  complex macros with a lot of programmic content. Finally, <value|scheme> is
  the safest format when incorporating <TeXmacs> snippets into emails.
  Indeed, both the standard <TeXmacs> format and the XML serialization may be
  quite sensitive to white-space.

  In order to save or load a document in <value|scheme> format, you may use
  <menu|File|Export|Scheme> <abbr|resp.> <menu|File|Import|Scheme>. Files
  saved in <value|scheme> format can easily be processed by external
  <value|scheme> programs, in the same way as files saved in XML format can
  easily be processed by tools for processing XML, like XSLT.

  In order to copy a document fragment to an email in <value|scheme> format,
  you may use <menu|Edit|Copy to|Scheme>. Similarly, you may paste external
  <value|scheme> fragments into <TeXmacs> using <menu|Edit|Paste
  from|Scheme>. The <value|scheme> format may also used interactively inside
  <value|scheme> sessions or interactive commands. For instance, typing
  <shortcut|(interactive exec-interactive-command)> followed by the interactive command

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (insert '(frac "1" "2"))
  </scheme-fragment>

  inserts the fraction <frac|1|2> at the current cursor position.

  <tmdoc-title|Macro primitives>

  Macros can be used to define new tags and to build procedural abstractions
  in style files.

  Older versions of <TeXmacs> used to make a distinction between macros (all
  children accessible) and functions (no accessible child). In modern
  <TeXmacs> there are only macros: the accessibility of children is
  determined heuristically and can be controlled with
  <markup|drd-props>.<htab|5mm>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|macro|var-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|var-n|body><explain-synopsis|macro
    of fixed arity>
  <|explain>
    This primitive returns a macro (the <TeXmacs> analogue of a
    <math|\<lambda\>>-expression) with <math|n> arguments, named after the
    literal strings <src-arg|var-1> until <src-arg|var-n>.

    New tags are defined by storing macros in the environment. Most of the
    time, macros are stored without scope with <markup|assign>, but it is
    sometimes useful to redefine a tag locally within the scope of a
    <markup|with>. For example, itemized and enumerated environment redefine
    <markup|item> locally.

    <\example>
      Definition of the <markup|abbr> tag

      <\tm-fragment>
        <inactive*|<assign|abbr|<macro|x|<rigid|<arg|x>>>>>
      </tm-fragment>
    </example>

    Storing a <markup|macro> in the environment defines a tag whose arity is
    fixed to the number of arguments taken by the macro.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|arg|var|index-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|index-n><explain-synopsis|retrieve
    macro arguments>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is used to retrieve the arguments of a macro within its
    body. For instance, <explain-macro|arg|var> expands the content of the
    macro argument with name <src-arg|var> (literal string). Of course, this
    argument must be defined by a <markup|macro> containing the <markup|arg>
    tag.

    This tag is similar to <markup|value>, but differs in important ways:

    <\itemize>
      <item>The argument namespace is distinct from the environment,
      <explain-macro|arg|var> and <explain-macro|value|var> will generally
      evaluate to different values (although you should not rely on this).

      <item>The value of <markup|arg> retains the position of the macro
      argument in the document tree, that makes it possible to edit the
      arguments of a macro-defined tag while it is active.
    </itemize>

    When more than one argument is specified,
    <explain-macro|arg|var|index-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|index-n> expands to a
    subtree of the argument <src-arg|var>. The value of the named argument
    must be a compound tree (not a string). The operands <src-arg|var> until
    <src-arg|index-n> must all evaluate to positive integers and give the
    path to the subtree of the macro argument.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|xmacro|var|body><explain-synopsis|macro with a variable
    arity>
  <|explain>
    This primitive returns a macro (the <TeXmacs> analogue of a
    <math|\<lambda\>>-expression) capable of taking any number of arguments.
    The arguments are stored in the macro variable with name <src-arg|var> (a
    literal string) during the evaluation of the <src-arg|body>. The
    <math|i>-th individual argument can then be accessed using
    <explain-macro|arg|var|i>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|map-args|foo|root|var>

    <explain-macro|map-args|foo|root|var|first>

    <explain-macro|map-args|foo|root|var|first|last><explain-synopsis|map a
    tag on subtrees of an argument>
  <|explain>
    This primitive evaluates to a tree whose root is labeled by
    <src-arg|root> and whose children are the result of applying the macro
    <src-arg|foo> to the children of the macro argument with name
    <src-arg|var>.

    By default, the macro <src-arg|foo> is applied to all children. If
    <src-arg|first> has been specified, then we rather start at the
    <math|i>-th child of <src-arg|var>, where <math|i> is the result of
    evaluating <src-arg|first>. If <src-arg|last> has been specified too,
    then we stop at the <math|j>-th child of <src-arg|var> (the <math|j>-th
    child not being included), where <math|j> is the result of evaluating
    <src-arg|last>. In this last case, the arity of the returned tree is
    therefore <math|j-i>.

    Stated otherwise, <markup|map-args> applies <src-arg|foo> to all subtrees
    of the macro argument <src-arg|var> (or a range of subtrees if
    <src-arg|first> and <src-arg|last> are specified) and collects the result
    in a tree with label <src-arg|root>. In addition, the second argument to
    <src-arg|foo> gives its position of the first argument in the expansion
    of <src-arg|var>.

    The <markup|map-args> is analogue to the <scheme> function
    <verbatim|map>. Since <TeXmacs> use labeled trees, the label of the
    mapping list must also be specified.

    <\example>
      Comma-separated lists.

      The <markup|comma-separated> tag has any arity (though it does not make
      much sense with arity zero) and typesets its operands interspersed with
      commas.

      <\tm-fragment>
        <inactive*|<assign|comma-extra|<macro|x|, <arg|x>>>>

        <inactive*|<assign|comma-separated|<xmacro|args|<style-with|src-compact|none|<arg|args|0><map-args|comma-extra|concat|args|1>>>>>
      </tm-fragment>
    </example>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|eval-args|var><explain-synopsis|macro with a variable
    arity>
  <|explain>
    This primitive evaluates to the tree with the same label as the expansion
    of the argument <src-arg|var> and whose subtrees are the result of the
    evaluation of the subtrees of the expansion of <src-arg|var>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|compound|foo|arg-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|arg-n><explain-synopsis|expand
    an unnamed macro>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is useful to expand macros which are the result of a
    computation: it applies the macro which is the result of the evaluation
    of <src-arg|foo> to the arguments <src-arg|arg-1> until <src-arg|arg-n>.
    The <markup|compound> primitive is useful in call-back and lambda
    programming idioms, where a <def-index|higher-level macro> is given a
    macro as an operand, which it may later apply under certain conditions or
    with operands which are not known to the client code.

    Actually, in the current implementation, <src-arg|foo> may either
    evaluate to a macro or to a literal string which gives the name of a
    macro. However, we discourage users to rely on the second case.

    <\example>
      Lambda programming with macros.

      In the code below, <explain-macro|filter|pred|t> expects a macro
      <src-arg|pred> and a tuple <src-arg|t> on input and returns a tuple
      containing the elements of <src-arg|t> for which <src-arg|pred>

      As an application, we may define a macro <explain-macro|evens|t>, which

      returns the tuple of integers in <src-arg|t> which are divisible by 2.

  <|explain>
    The arity and children accessibility of tags defined by macros are
    determined heuristically by default. The <markup|drd-props> primitive
    overrides this default for the environment variable (usually a macro)
    with name <src-arg|var>. The currently supported property-value pairs
    are:

    <\description-dash>
      <item*|(arity, <math|n>)>Sets the arity to the given fixed value
      <math|n> (literal integer).

      <item*|(accessible, all)>Make it impossible to deactivate the tag with
      normal editor actions. Inaccessible children become effectively
      uneditable.

      <item*|(accessible, none)>Make it impossible to position the caret
      within the tag when it is active, so children can only be edited when
      the tag is inactive.
    </description-dash>

  <tmdoc-title|<TeXmacs> over the network and over the web>

  It should be quite easy to write a plug-in for <TeXmacs> for doing instant
  messenging or live-conferencing. We are very interested in people who would
  like to help with this. The same techniques might be used for collaborative
  authoring and educational purposes.

  Besides live conferencing, we are also interested by people who are willing
  to program better integration of <TeXmacs> with the web. As a first step,
  this would require an internal C++ plug-in based on <name|Wget> or
  <name|Curl> for accessing web-pages, which supports cookies, security, etc.
  At a second stage, these features should be exploited by the Html
  converters. At the last stage, one might develop more general web-based
  services.

<TeXmacs|1.0.7.20>

<style|tmdoc>

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Standard <TeXmacs> styles>

  The main <TeXmacs> styles are:

  <\explain|<tmstyle|generic>>
    This is the default style when you open a new document. The purpose of
    this style is to produce quick, informal documents. For this reason, the
    layout of paragraphs is very simple: instead of indenting the first lines
    of paragraphs, they are rather separated by white-space.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmstyle|article>>
    This style may be used for writing short scientific articles, which are
    subdivided into sections. The numbering of environments like theorems,
    remarks, <abbr|etc.> is relative to the entire document. If you use the
    <tmpackage|number-long-article> package, then the numbers are prefixed by
    the section number.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmstyle|beamer>>
    This style may be used for the creation of highly interactive laptop
    presentations. By default, we use a ``bluish'' theme similar to the
    <LaTeX> beamer package, but other themes can be selected from the menus.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmstyle|book>>
    This is the basic style for writing books. Books are assumed to be
    subdivided into chapters and numbers of environments are prefixed by the
    chapter number. In general, it is also comfortable to store each chapter
    in a separate file, so that they can be edited more efficiently. This
    issue is explained in more detail in the section about <hlink|books and
    multifile documents|../links/man-multifile.en.tm>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmstyle|seminar>>
    Documents based on this style are typically printed on slides for
    presentations using an overhead projector. You may also want to use it
    when making presentation directly from your laptop, after selecting
    <menu|View|Presentation mode>. Notice however, that slides correspond to
    real pages, whereas you rather should use ``switches'' in presentation
    mode.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmstyle|source>>
    This is the privileged style for editing style files and packages. It
    enables ``source mode'', so that documents are rendered in a way which
    makes the structure fully apparent. For more details, we refer to the
    section on the <hlink|rendering of style
    files|../../devel/style/presentation/src-present.en.tm>.
  </explain>

  The <tmstyle|article> style admits several variants, so as to make the
  layout correspond to the policy of specific journals. Currently, we have
  implemented <TeXmacs> analogues of the common <LaTeX> styles
  <tmstyle|amsart>, <tmstyle|acmconf>, <tmstyle|elsart>, <tmstyle|ieeeconf>,
  <tmstyle|aip>, <tmstyle|aps>, <tmstyle|svjour>, etc. Similarly, we are
  developing styles <tmstyle|tmarticle> and <tmstyle|tmbook> which provide an
  alternative layout for articles and books.

  In addition to variants of the <tmstyle|article> and <tmstyle|book> styles,
  <TeXmacs> provides also a few other styles, which are based on the main
  styles, but which provide some additional markup.

  <\explain|<tmstyle|letter>>
    This style is based on the informal <tmstyle|generic> style, but it
    provides additional markup for writing letters. The additional macros are
    mainly used for headers and endings of letters.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmstyle|exam>>
    This style, which is again based on <tmstyle|generic>, provides some
    additional markup for headers of exams. It also customizes the rendering
    of exercises.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmstyle|tmdoc>>
    This style is used for writing the <TeXmacs> documentation. It contains
    several tags for special types of content and extensions for linking,
    indexing, document traversal, <abbr|etc.>. Some aspects of this style are
    still under heavy development.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Writing your first interface with <apply|TeXmacs>>

  In order to write your first interface to <apply|TeXmacs>, we recommend you
  to follow the following steps:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>Create a <verbatim|--texmacs> option for your program which will be
    used for calling your program from inside <apply|TeXmacs>.

    <item>Modify your output routines in a such a way that the appropriate
    output is send to <apply|TeXmacs> when your program is started with the
    <verbatim|--texmacs> option.

    <item>Create a <verbatim|mycas> script in your path which executes your
    program with the <verbatim|--texmacs> option.
  </enumerate>

  After doing this, your program will be available under the name
  <apply|menu|Mycas> in <apply|menu|Insert|Session>. We will explain later how
  to make your system listed under its own name, how to customize it, and how
  to get the interface incorporated into the main <apply|TeXmacs>
  distribution.

  Usually, step 2 is the most complicated one and the time it will cost you
  depends on how your system was designed. If you designed clean output
  routines (including the routines for displaying error messages), then it
  usually suffices to modify these by mimicking the <verbatim|mycas> example
  and reusing existing <apply|LaTeX> output routines, which most systems
  provide.

  At the moment, we only implemented <apply|LaTeX> as a standard transmission
  format for mathematical formulas, because this is the format which is most
  widely used. In the future, we intend to implement more semantically secure
  formats, and we recommend you to keep in mind the possibility of sending
  your output in tree format.

  Nevertheless, we enriched standard <apply|LaTeX> with the <verbatim|\\*>
  and <verbatim|\\bignone> commands for multiplication and closing big
  operators. This allows us to distinguish between:\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ a \\* (b + c)
  </verbatim>

  (or <with|mode|math|a> multiplied by <with|mode|math|b+c>) and:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ f(x + y)
  </verbatim>

  (or <with|mode|math|f> applied to <with|mode|math|x+y>). Similarly, in:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ \\sum_{i=1}^m a_i \\bignone + \\sum_{j=1}^n b_j \\bignone
  </verbatim>

  the <verbatim|\\bignone> command is used in order to specify the scopes of
  the <verbatim|\\sum> operators.

  It turns out that the systematic use of the <verbatim|\\*> and
  <verbatim|\\bignone> commands, in combination with clean <apply|LaTeX>
  output for the remaining constructs, makes it <with|font shape|italic|a
  priori> possible to associate an appropriate meaning to your output. In
  particular, this usually makes it possible to write additional routines for
  copying and pasting formulae between different systems.

  <tmdoc-title|Creating tables>

  In order to create a table, you may either use <menu|Insert|Table> or one
  of the following keyboard shorthands:

  <\description>
    <item*|<key|table N t>>Create a plain table.

    <item*|<key|table N T>>Create a table whose cells are centered.

    <item*|<key|table N b>>Create a ``block'', whose cells all have a small
    border.

    <item*|<key|table N B>>Create a block whose cells are centered.
  </description>

  In math mode, a few other table-like structures are provided:

  <\description>
    <item*|<key|table N m>>Create a matrix.

    <item*|<key|table N d>>Create a determinant.

    <item*|<key|table N c>>Create a choice list.
  </description>

  Examples of a plain table, a centered block and a matrix are shown below.
  Notice that the environments with the explanatory text below the tables
  were created using <menu|Insert|Table|Small table>. The use of ``small
  tables'' allows you to put several tables besides each other on the same
  line. For a single large table, one may use <menu|Insert|Table|Big
  table>.<vspace|0.5fn>

  <\with|par-mode|center>
    <small-table|<tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|boom>|<cell|tree>>|<row|<cell|hallo>|<cell|hello>>|<row|<cell|wiskunde>|<cell|mathematics>>>>>|A
    plain table.><small-table|<block*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|boom>|<cell|tree>>|<row|<cell|hallo>|<cell|hello>>|<row|<cell|wiskunde>|<cell|mathematics>>>>>|A
    centered block.><small-table|<math|<with|math-display|true|<matrix|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|a>|<cell|b>>|<row|<cell|c>|<cell|d>>>>>>>|A
    matrix.>
  </with>

  <vspace*|0.5fn>There are several other table-like environments and new ones
  may be created by the user. For instance, using
  <menu|Insert|Mathematics|Equations> or <key|math &>, you may insert an
  <markup|eqnarray*> environment, which allows mathematically oriented users
  to align a list of equations which span over entire lines. An example of
  such a list of equations is

  <\eqnarray*>
    <tformat|<table|<row|<cell|sin (f(x)*g(x))<rprime|'>>|<cell|=>|<cell|(f(x)*g(x))<rprime|'>*cos
    (f(x)*g(x))>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|=>|<cell|(f<rprime|'>(x)*g(x)+f(x)*g<rprime|'>(x))*cos
    (f(x)*g(x))>>>>
  </eqnarray*>

  When starting a new table, its size is minimal (usually
  <with|mode|math|1\<times\>1>) and its cells are empty. New rows and columns
  are inserted using the <shortcut|(structured-insert-left)>, <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)>,
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-up)> and <shortcut|(structured-insert-down)> shorthands. For instance,
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)> creates a new column at the right of the current cursor
  position, as illustrated in the figure below. You may also start a new row
  below the current cursor position by hitting <shortcut|(kbd-return)>.

  <\big-figure>
    <\equation*>
      <matrix|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|a<value|cursor>>|<cell|b>>|<row|<cell|c>|<cell|d>>>>><space|2em>\<longrightarrow\><space|2em><matrix|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|a>|<cell|<value|cursor>>|<cell|b>>|<row|<cell|c>|<cell|>|<cell|d>>>>>
    </equation*>
  <|big-figure>
    Example of the insertion of a new column in a matrix. Assuming that the
    cursor is at the position indicated in the left-hand matrix, insertion of
    a new column using <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)> results in the right-hand matrix.
  </big-figure>

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Introduction>

  Like <name|Emacs>, <apply|TeXmacs> comes with a <name|Lisp>-like extension
  language, namely the <with|font shape|small-caps|Guile Scheme> dialect from
  the <with|font shape|small-caps|Gnome> project. For documentation about
  <with|font shape|small-caps|Guile Scheme>, we refer to\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html
  </verbatim>

  <apply|scheme> has the advantage that it may be extended with extern C and
  C++ types and routines. In our case, we have extended <apply|scheme> with
  routines which you can use to create your own menus and key-combinations,
  and even to write your own extensions to <apply|TeXmacs>.

  If you have downloaded the source files of <apply|TeXmacs>, then it may be
  interesting for you to take a look at the files\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ Guile/Glue/build-glue-basic.scm<format|next line>
    \ \ Guile/Glue/build-glue-editor.scm<format|next line>
    \ \ Guile/Glue/build-glue-server.scm
  </verbatim>

  These three ``glue'' files contain the C++ routines, which are visible
  within <apply|scheme>. In what follows, we will discuss some of the most
  important routines. We plan to write a more complete reference guide later.
  You may also take a look at the scheme <verbatim|.scm> files in the
  directory <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs>.

  purpose, it is possible to write your own style files. However, designing
  your own style files from scratch may be a complex task, so it is usually
  preferable to customize the existing styles. This requires some
  understanding of the global architecture of the standard style files and a
  more precise understanding of the parts you wish to customize. In this
  section, we will explain the general principles. For more details, we refer
  to the chapter on the <hyper-link|principal <TeXmacs>
  tags|../../../main/styles/std-dtds/dtds.en.tm>.

  <tmdoc-title|<TeXmacs> lengths>

  A simple <TeXmacs> length is a number followed by a length unit, like
  <verbatim|1cm> or <verbatim|1.5mm>. <TeXmacs> supports three main types of
  units:

  <\description>
    <item*|Absolute units>The length of an absolute unit like <verbatim|cm>
    or <verbatim|pt> on print is fixed.

    <item*|Context dependent units>Context-dependent length units depend on
    the current font or other environment variables. For instance,
    <verbatim|1ex> corresponds to the height of the ``x'' character in the
    current font and <verbatim|1par> correspond to the current paragraph
    width.

    <item*|User defined units>Any nullary macro, whose name contains only
    lower case roman letters followed by <verbatim|-length>, and which
    returns a length, can be used as a unit itself. For instance, the
    following macro defines the <verbatim|dm> length:

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<assign|dm-length|<macro|10cm>>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </description>

  Furthermore, length units can be <em|stretchable>. A stretchable length is
  represented by a triple of rigid lengths: a minimal length, a default
  length and a maximal length. When justifying lines or pages, stretchable
  lengths are automatically sized so as to produce nicely looking layout.

  In the case of page breaking, the <src-var|page-flexibility> environment
  provides additional control over the stretchability of white space. When
  setting the <src-var|page-flexibility> to <math|1>, stretchable spaces
  behave as usual. When setting the <src-var|page-flexibility> to <math|0>,
  stretchable spaces become rigid. For other values, the behaviour is linear.

  <paragraph*|Absolute length units>

  <\description>
    <item*|<code*|cm>>One centimeter.

    <item*|<code*|mm>>One millimeter.

    <item*|<code*|in>>One inch.

    <item*|<code*|pt>>The standard typographic point corresponds to
    <math|1/72.27> of an inch.

    <item*|<verbatim|bp>>A big point corresponds to <math|1/72> of an inch.

    <item*|<verbatim|dd>>The Didt point equals 1/72 of a French inch,
    <abbr|i.e.> <verbatim|0.376mm>.

    <item*|<verbatim|pc>>One ``pica'' equals 12 points.

    <item*|<verbatim|cc>>One ``cicero'' equals 12 Didt points.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Rigid font-dependent length units>

  <\description>
    <item*|<verbatim|fs>>The font size. When using a <verbatim|12pt> font,
    <verbatim|1fs> corresponds to <verbatim|12pt>.

    <item*|<verbatim|fbs>>The base font size. Typically, when selecting
    <verbatim|10> as the font size for your document and when typing large
    text, the base font size is <verbatim|10pt> and the font size
    <verbatim|12pt>.

    <item*|<code*|ln>>The width of a nicely looking fraction bar for the
    current font.

    <item*|<code*|sep>>A typical separation between text and graphics for the
    current font, so as to keep the text readable. For instance, the
    numerator in a fraction is shifted up by <verbatim|1sep>.

    <item*|<verbatim|yfrac>>The height of the fraction bar for the current
    font (approximately <verbatim|0.5ex>).

    <item*|<verbatim|ex>>The height of the ``x'' character in the current
    font.

    <item*|<verbatim|emunit>>The width of the ``M'' character in the current
    font.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Stretchable font-dependent length units>

  <\description>
    <item*|<code*|fn>>This is a stretchable variant of <verbatim|1quad>. The
    default length of <verbatim|1fn> is <verbatim|1quad>. When stretched,
    <verbatim|1fn> may be reduced to <verbatim|0.5fn> and extended to
    <verbatim|1.5fn>.

    <item*|<verbatim|fns>>This length defaults to zero, but it may be
    stretched up till <verbatim|1fn>.

    <item*|<verbatim|bls>>The ``base line skip'' is the sum of
    <verbatim|1quad> and <src-var|par-sep>. It corresponds to the distance
    between successive lines of normal text.

    Typically, the baselines of successive lines are separated by a distance
    of <verbatim|1fn> (in <TeXmacs> and <LaTeX> a slightly larger space is
    used though so as to allow for subscripts and superscripts and avoid a
    too densely looking text. When stretched, <verbatim|1fn> may be reduced
    to <verbatim|0.5fn> and extended to <verbatim|1.5fn>.

    <item*|<code*|spc>>The (stretchable) width of space character in the
    current font.

    <item*|<verbatim|xspc>>The additional (stretchable) width of a space
    character after a period.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Box lengths><label|box-lengths>

  Box length units can only be used within some special markup elements, such
  as <markup|move>, <markup|shift>, <markup|resize>, <markup|clipped> and
  <markup|image>. The principal body of this content (<abbr|e.g.> the content
  being ``moved'' in the case of <markup|move>) is typeset as a box. The
  following lengths units then correspond to the size and the extents of the
  box.

  <\description>
    <item*|<code*|w>>The width of the box.

    <item*|<verbatim|h>>The height of the box.

    <item*|<code*|l>>The logical left <math|x>-coordinate of the box.

    <item*|<code*|r>>The logical right <math|x>-coordinate of the box.

    <item*|<code*|b>>The logical bottom <math|y>-coordinate of the box.

    <item*|<code*|t>>The logical top <math|y>-coordinate of the box.
  </description>

  For instance, the code

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<move|Hello there||<plus|-0.5b|-0.5t>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  can be used to center <move|Hello there||<plus|-0.5b|-0.5t>> at the
  base-line.

  <paragraph*|Other length units>

  <\description>
    <item*|<code*|par>>The width of the paragraph. That is the length the
    text can span. It is affected by paper size, margins, number of columns,
    column separation, cell width (if in a table), <abbr|etc.>

    <item*|<verbatim|pag>>The height of the main text in a page. In a similar
    way as <verbatim|par>, this length unit is affected by page size,
    margins, <abbr|etc.>

    <item*|<code*|px>>One screen pixel, the meaning of this unit is affected
    by the shrinking factor.

    <item*|<code*|tmpt>>The smallest length unit for internal length
    calculations by <TeXmacs>. <verbatim|1px> divided by the shrinking factor
    corresponds to <verbatim|256tmpt>.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Different ways to specify lengths>

  There are three types of lengths in <TeXmacs>:

  <\description>
    <item*|Simple lengths>A string consisting of a number followed by a
    length unit.

    <item*|Abstract lengths>An abstract length is a macro which evaluates to
    a length. Such lengths have the advantage that they may depend on the
    context.

    <item*|Normalized lengths>All lengths are ultimately converted into a
    normalized length, which is a tag of the form <explain-macro|tmlen|l>
    (for rigid lengths) or <explain-macro|tmlen|min|def|max> (for stretchable
    lengths). The user may also use this tag in order to specify stretchable
    lengths. For instance, <inactive*|<tmlen|<minus|1quad|1pt>|1quad|1.5quad>>
    evaluates to a length which is <verbatim|1quad> by default, at least
    <verbatim|1quad-1pt> and at most <verbatim|1.5quad>.

  <tmdoc-title|Improved spacing inside formulas (1.0.7.10)>

  In the new version, the spacing around mathematical operators has been made
  dependent on the semantic context. For instance, when used as an infix
  operator in a subtraction <math|x-y>, there are small spaces around the
  minus sign <math|->; this is no longer the case in <math|-x>, where we
  use the minus as a<nbsp>prefix. Similarly, the spacing inside lists of operators
  <math|+,-,\<times\>> is now correct. However, the modification may alter
  the spacing inside some formulas in existing documents. For critical
  documents, you may thus want to review the line breaking.

  Some of the keyboard shortcuts inside formulas have also been modified. For
  instance, <math|\<wedge\>> and <math|\<vee\>> are now obtained by typing
  <key|&> <abbr|resp.> <key|%>. The shortcuts for <math|\<in\>>,
  <math|\<prec\>> and <math|\|> have also been changed. For more information,
  please refer to the documentation on <hlink|editing mathematical
  formulas|$TEXMACS_DOC_PATH/main/math/man-math.en.tm>. At this place, you
  will also find more information about the newly added semantic editing
  features.

  <tmdoc-title|Auto-matching brackets (1.0.7.9)>

  From now on, inside mathematical formulas, all brackets have to match and
  all big operators should admit well-specified scopes. To this effect, the
  way parenthesized expressions are edited has changed, although the old
  non-matching editing style can be restored using
  <menu|Edit|Preferences|Keyboard|Automatic brackets|Disable>.

  Documents for previous versions of <TeXmacs> will be upgraded automatically
  in order to make all brackets match and determine the scopes of big
  operators. Although this task is accomplished using heuristics, the result
  should be correct most of the time. In any case, from the typesetting point
  of view, the upgraded documents will always look the same.

  <tmdoc-title|More context dependent interface (1.0.7.8)>

  The interface of the new version of <TeXmacs> is more context dependent. On
  the one hand, the menus and toolbars have been reorganized. Several items
  from the <menu|Insert> menu have been moved to the <menu|Format> menu,
  whereas the context dependent menus <menu|Text>, <menu|Mathematics>,
  <menu|Table>, <menu|Session>, <abbr|etc.> have disappeared, their contents
  being moved to the <menu|Insert> menu.

  On the other hand, a new top-level <menu|Focus> menu has been created. Its
  contents is highly context dependent and determined as a function of the
  <em|current focus>. Similarly, a third <em|focus toolbar> has been
  introduced. For more information, we refer to the section on <hlink|typing
  structured text|$TEXMACS_DOC_PATH/main/text/man-structure.en.tm>.

  <TeXmacs> developers should also notice that the introduction of the focus
  has modified the way contextual overloading is done. For more details, we
  refer to the sections on <hlink|contextual
  overloading|$TEXMACS_DOC_PATH/devel/scheme/overview/overview-overloading.en.tm> and
  <hlink|the <TeXmacs> editing model|$TEXMACS_DOC_PATH/devel/scheme/edit/edit-model.en.tm>.

  <tmdoc-title|Default look and feel (1.0.7.7)>

  From this version on, the default <em|look and feel> of <TeXmacs> depends
  on your operating system and environment. The implemented <em|look and
  feels> (<name|Emacs>, <name|Gnome>, <name|KDE>, <name|MacOS>,
  <name|Windows>) attempt to be as compatible as possible with the <em|look
  and feel> of other applications on your system. You may choose an
  alternative <em|look and feel> in <menu|Edit|Preferences|Look and feel>.

  In order to make the <TeXmacs> keyboard shortcuts as compatible as possible
  with the standards on your system, we have redefined many of the keyboard
  shortcuts. Although these changes will only marginally affect the
  <name|Emacs> <em|look and feel>, there will be substential changes for all
  other <em|look and feels>.

  If you upgrade from a previous <TeXmacs> version with the <name|Emacs>
  <em|look and feel>, then you will be able to keep most of your habits. In all
  contrary cases, including installation of <TeXmacs> on a<nbsp>new computer,
  you probably need to retake a look at our sections on <hlink|keyboard
  configuration|$TEXMACS_DOC_PATH/main/config/man-config-keyboard.en.tm> and
  <hlink|mastering the keyboard|$TEXMACS_DOC_PATH/main/text/keyboard/man-keyboard.en.tm>. In cases of doubt, please refer to the user manual;
  the keyboard shortcuts in the manual are automatically adapted
  to the active <em|look and feel>.

  (for <name|Unix>) comes with a minimal set of EC fonts for European
  languages, but an additional font package can be downloaded from our web
  site (the additional fonts are directly included in the <name|Windows>
  version). Whenever a given font is not available as a type 1 font, then
  <TeXmacs> falls back on <name|Metafont> in order to generate a Type<nbsp>3
  substitute. This behaviour can be further customized in
  <menu|Edit|Preferences|Printer|Font type>.

  Previous versions of <TeXmacs> provided the ``project'' mechanism for
  dealing with large documents like books. In the new version, any large
  structured document can be transformed into a multi-part document whose
  individual parts can be viewed and edited in an efficient way (see
  <menu|Document|Part>). Former multi-file projects are deprecated although
  still supported. They can be transformed into multi-part documents using
  <menu|Tools|Project|Expand inclusions>. A new multi-part document
  corresponds to a single file.

  expected to be correct for documents with a single author. For documents
  with multiple authors, you may have to re-enter the title using our new

  <tmdoc-title|Formatted and structured output>

  In the <hlink|previous section|interface-pipes.en.tm>, we have seen that
  output from applications is encapsulated in blocks of the form

  <\quotation>
    <framed-fragment|<verbatim|<render-key|DATA_BEGIN><em|format>:<em|message><render-key|DATA_END>>>
  </quotation>

  Currently implemented formats include <verbatim|verbatim>,
  <verbatim|latex>, <verbatim|html>, <verbatim|ps>, and <verbatim|scheme>.
  Certain formats, such as <verbatim|verbatim>, allow the
  <verbatim|<em|message>> to recursively contain blocks of the same form. The
  <verbatim|scheme> format is used for sending <TeXmacs> trees in the form of
  <scheme> expressions.

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|formula> plug-in>

  The <verbatim|formula> plug-in demonstrates the use of <LaTeX> as the
  output format. It consists of the files

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|formula/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|formula/progs/init-formula.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|formula/src/formula.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  The body of the main loop of <verbatim|formula.cpp> is given by

  <\cpp-code>
    int i, nr;

    cin \<gtr\>\<gtr\> nr;

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "latex:";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "$";

    for (i=1; i\<less\>nr; i++)

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> "x_{" \<less\>\<less\> i \<less\>\<less\> "}+";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "x_{" \<less\>\<less\> i \<less\>\<less\> "}$";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  Similarly, the use of nested output blocks is demonstrated by the
  <verbatim|nested> plug-in; see in particular the source file
  <example-plugin-link|nested/src/nested.cpp>.

  <\remark>
    At the moment, we only implemented <LaTeX> as a standard transmission
    format for mathematical formulas, because this is the format which is
    most widely used. In the future, we intend to implement more semantically
    secure formats, and we recommend you to keep in mind the possibility of
    sending your output in tree format.

    Nevertheless, we enriched standard <LaTeX> with the <verbatim|\\*> and
    <verbatim|\\bignone> commands for multiplication and closing big
    operators. This allows us to distinguish between

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ a \\* (b + c)
    </verbatim>

    (<abbr|i.e.> <math|a> multiplied by <math|b+c>) and

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ f(x + y)
    </verbatim>

    (<abbr|i.e.> <math|f> applied to <math|x+y>). Similarly, in

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ \\sum_{i=1}^m a_i \\bignone + \\sum_{j=1}^n b_j \\bignone
    </verbatim>

    the <verbatim|\\bignone> command is used in order to specify the scopes
    of the <verbatim|\\sum> operators.

    It turns out that the systematic use of the <verbatim|\\*> and
    <verbatim|\\bignone> commands, in combination with clean <LaTeX> output
    for the remaining constructs, makes it <with|font-shape|italic|a priori>
    possible to associate an appropriate meaning to your output. In
    particular, this usually makes it possible to write additional routines
    for copying and pasting formulae between different systems.
  </remark>

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|markup> plug-in>

  It is important to remind that structured output can be combined with the
  power of <TeXmacs> as a structured editor. For instance, the
  <verbatim|markup> plug-in demonstrates the definition of an additional tag
  <markup|foo>, which is used as an additional primitive in the output of the
  application. More precisely, the <verbatim|markup> plug-in consists of the
  following files:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|markup/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|markup/packages/session/markup.ts>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|markup/progs/init-markup.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|markup/src/markup.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  The style package <tmpackage|markup.ts> contains the following definition
  for <markup|foo>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<math|<assign|foo|<macro|x|<frac|1|1+<arg|x>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <markup|foo> tag is used in the following way in the body of the main
  loop of <verbatim|markup.cpp>:

  <\cpp-code>
    char buffer[100];

    cin.getline (buffer, 100, '\\n');

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "latex:";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "$\\\\foo{" \<less\>\<less\> buffer
    \<less\>\<less\> "}$";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  Notice that the style package <tmpackage|markup.ts> also defines the
  <markup|markup-output> environment:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|markup-output|<macro|body|<generic-output|<with|par-mode|center|<arg|body>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  This has the effect of centering the output in sessions started using
  <menu|Insert|Session|Markup>.

  <tmdoc-title|Making donations to the <TeXmacs> project>

  <paragraph*|Making donations to TeXmacs through the SPI organization>

  One very important way to support <TeXmacs> is by donating money to the
  project. <TeXmacs> is currently \ one of the projets of <inactive|> SPI
  (Software in the Public Interest; see <verbatim|http://www.spi-inc.org>).
  You may make donations of money to TeXmacs via this organization, by noting
  on your check or e-mail for wire transfers that your money should go to the
  TeXmacs project. You may also make donations of equipment or services or
  donations through vendors. See the SPI website for more information. The
  list of donators is maintained at our website.

  <paragraph*|Details on how to donate money>

  To make a donation, write a check or money order to:

  <\quotation>
    <em|Software in the Public Interest, Inc.>
  </quotation>

  and mail it to the following <label|address>address:

  <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
    <\quotation>
      Software in the Public Interest, Inc.

      P.O. Box 502761

      Indianapolis, IN 46250-7761

      United States
    </quotation>
  </with>

  To make an electronic transfer (this will work for non-US too), you need to
  give your bank the routing number and account number as follows:

  <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
    <\quotation>
      The SPI bank account is at American Express Centurion Bank.

      <\with|font-family|tt>
        <with|font-series|bold|Routing Number: >124071889

        <with|font-series|bold|Account Number: >1296789
      </with>
    </quotation>
  </with>

  Don't forget to note on your check or e-mail for wire transfers that the
  money should be spent on the TeXmacs projet. In addition you may specify a
  more specific purpose on which you would like us to spend the money. You
  may also <hyper-link|contact us|../../authors/contact.en.tm> for a more
  detailed discussion on this issue.

  <paragraph*|Important notes>

  Let the SPI Treasurer (<verbatim|treasurer@spi-inc.org>) know if you have
  problems. When you have completed the electronic wire, please send a copy
  of the receipt to the above address so there is a copy of your donation.
  The copy you send to the treasurer is important. You may also want to
  <hyper-link|contact|../../authors/contact.en.tm> the TeXmacs team in order
  to make sure that the money arrived on the TeXmacs account.

  <\with|font-shape|italic>
    <with|font-series|bold|Note:> The SPI address and account numbers may
    change from time to time. Please do not copy the address and account
    numbers, but rather point to the page
    <verbatim|http://www.spi-inc.org/donations> to ensure that donors will
    always see the most current information.
  </with>

  <em|Donations in Europe> can be done through our partner in Germany, ffis
  e.V. If you are interested in using their bank account (to save
  international money transfer costs), please check the instructions on
  <verbatim|http://www.ffis.de/Verein/spi-en.html>.

  <tmdoc-title|Configuring <TeXmacs>>

  When starting <TeXmacs> for the first time, the program automatically
  configures itself in a way which it thinks to be most suitable for you. For
  instance, <TeXmacs> will attempt to determine your systems settings for the
  language and the paper type of your printer. However, the automatic
  configuration may sometimes fail or you may want to use an alternative
  configuration. In that case, you should go to the <menu|Edit|Preferences>
  menu and specify your preferences.

  In particular, we recommend you to configure the desired ``look and feel''
  of <TeXmacs>. By default, we use a native look and feel, which will ensure
  that keyboard shortcuts and menu layout are similar to other applications
  on your system. But we also provide an <name|Emacs> look and feel, which
  ensures a limited compatibility of the <TeXmacs> keyboard shortcuts with
  those of <name|Emacs>.

  <tmdoc-title|Creating sessions>

  A session can be started from the <menu|Insert|Session> menu. Since
  <TeXmacs> is based on the <name|Scheme> language, it is always possible to
  start a <name|Scheme> session using <menu|Insert|Session|Scheme>. On
  <name|Unix> systems, it is usually also possible to start <name|Bash> shell
  sessions using <menu|Insert|Session|Shell>. The remainder of the items in
  the <menu|Insert|Session> menu depend on the plug-ins which are installed
  on your system.

  A session consists of a sequence of input and output fields and possible
  text between them. When pressing <shortcut|(kbd-return)> inside an input
  field of a session, the text inside the environment is evaluated and the
  result is displayed in an output field.

  When entering a command in a session, the application attempts to execute
  it. Several commands may be launched concurrently in the same document, but
  the output will only be active in the session where the cursor is and at
  the place of the cursor. Therefore, we recommend to use different buffers
  for parallel executions.

  For each type of extern application, one may choose between sharing a
  single process by different sessions, or launching a separate process for
  each different session. More precisely, when inserting a session using
  <menu|Insert|Session|Other>, you may specify both a ``session type''
  (Shell, Pari, Maxima, <abbr|etc.>) and a ``session name'' (the default name
  is ``default''). Sessions with different names correspond to different
  processes and sessions with the same name share a common process.

  In order to finish the process which underlies a given session, you may use
  <menu|Session|Close session>. When pressing <shortcut|(kbd-return)> in the
  input of a non-connected system, the system will be restarted
  automatically. You may also use <menu|Session|Interrupt execution> in order
  to interrupt the execution of a command. However, several applications do
  not support this feature.

  In order to evaluate all fields of <abbr|e.g.> a previously created
  session, you may use <menu|Session|Evaluate|Evaluate all>. Similarly,
  <menu|Session|Evaluate|Evaluate above> and <menu|Session|Evaluate|Evaluate
  below> allow you to evaluate all field above or below the current field.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Advanced table features>

  In the menus, you also find some other more special features for tables.
  Very briefly, these include the following:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Change the ``span'' of a cell and let it run over its neighbouring
    cells on its right and below.

    <item>Creation of entire subtables inside cells.

    <item>Correction of the depth and height of text, in order to let the
    baselines match.

    <item>Horizontal hyphenation of cell contents and vertical hyphenation of
    the entire table.

    <item>Gluing several rows and/or columns together, so that the glued
    cells become ``part of the borders'' of the remaining cells.

    <item>Disactivation of the table, in order to see its ``source code''.

    <item>Setting the ``extension center'' of a table. From now on, the
    formatting properties of this cell will be used for new cells created
    around this center.

    <item>Specification of the minimal and maximum size of a table, which
    will be respected during further editing. (this is mainly useful when
    creating table macros).
  </itemize>

  Currently, all tables come inside an environment like <markup|tabular>,
  <markup|block>, <markup|matrix>, etc. When creating your own table macros,
  you may use <apply|menu|Table|Special table properties|Extract format> to
  extract the format from a given table.

  It is difficult to give a precise roadmap for the <TeXmacs> development,

  needs, help by new contributors and personal moods. Nevertheless, we tend
  to spend a significant time on a few major objectives, while amusing
  ourselves with the implementation of a few new features. Roughly speaking,
  our roadmap can therefore be divided into three major parts:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>A limited number of major objectives for the upcoming stable
    versions (1.1 and 1.2).

    <item>A certain number of minor objectives, subject to continuous
    changes, and which progress as a function of available time.

    <item>Other projects, which are developed by external contributors, but
    which occasionnaly require changes in the <TeXmacs> core.

  <tmdoc-title|General prefix rules>

  Since there are many keyboard shortcuts, it is important to have some ways
  of classifying them in several categories, in order to make it easier to
  memorize them. As a general rule, keyboard shortcuts which fall in the same
  category are identified by a common prefix. The active prefixes heavily
  depend on the selected ``look and feel'' in <menu|Edit|Preferences>. In the
  current look and feel of your <TeXmacs> system,<space|0.4spc>the main
  common prefixes are as follows:

  <\description>
    <item*|<prefix|std>>Standard shortcuts, which are similar to shortcuts
    used by other applications (for the selected look and feel). For
    instance, <shortcut|(clipboard-paste "primary")> can be used for pasting
    text on your system.

    <item*|<prefix|cmd>><TeXmacs> shortcuts, which often rely on the current
    editing mode. For instance, <key|text s> produces <strong|strong> text in
    text mode and a square root <math|<sqrt|>> in math mode.

    <item*|<prefix|altcmd>>Compound <TeXmacs> shortcuts. Usually, these
    shortcuts first indicate the kind of markup to which the command will
    apply and then specify the specific command. For instance, the
    <key|executable> prefix is used for insering executable markup, which is
    useful for <hlink|writing style files|../../../devel/style/style.en.tm>.
    One example is the shortcut <key|executable +> for the insertion of an
    addition.

    <item*|<prefix|structured:geometry>>This prefix is used in combination
    with arrow keys and certain other special keys for <hlink|positioning and
    resizing objects|../../editing/man-structured-geometry.en.tm>

    <item*|<prefix|structured:move>>This prefix is used in combination with
    arrow keys and some other special keys for <hlink|structured cursor
    movements|../../editing/man-structured-move.en.tm>.

    <item*|<prefix|special>>This prefix is occasionally used in combination
    with letters and ponctuation symbols for creating some additional easy to
    remind shortcuts.

    <item*|<prefix|symbol>>This prefix can be used in combination with normal
    letters for the insertion of special symbols. For instance,
    <key|text:symbol s> yields  and <key|math:symbol a> yields
    <math|<op|\<amalg\>>>. The <prefix|symbol> prefix is also used for the
    insertion of ``literal characters''. For instance, <key|symbol \\> will
    always produce the \\ character, whereas the <key|\\> key is used for
    entering <hlink|hybrid commands|man-hybrid.en.tm>.
  </description>

  Unfortunately, <prefix|altcmd>-based shortcuts are superseded by system
  shortcuts on several systems. For instance, accented characters and common
  special symbols are entered using this prefix under <name|Mac OS>. In that
  case, you may use the <key*|escape> key as an equivalent for <key|altcmd>.
  For more information, we refer to the section on <hlink|keyboard
  configuration|../../config/man-config-keyboard.en.tm>.

    <verbatim|2> are all rendered in the same way as index level
    <verbatim|2>; this ensures that formulas like

    <\equation*>
      \<mathe\><rsup|\<mathe\><rsup|\<mathe\><rsup|\<mathe\><rsup|x>>>>=<frac|1+<frac|1|x+\<mathe\><rsup|x>>|1+<frac|1|\<mathe\><rsup|x>+<frac|1|\<mathe\><rsup|\<mathe\><rsup|x>>>>>
    </equation*>

    remain readable. The index level may be manually changed in
    <menu|Format|Index level>, so as to produce formulas like

    <\equation*>
      x<rsup|<with|math-level|0|y<rsup|<with|math-level|0|z>>>>
    </equation*>

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|mode|math|<inactive*|x<rsup|<with|math-level|0|y<rsup|<with|math-level|0|z>>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|math-display|false><explain-synopsis|display style>
  <|explain>
    This environement variable controls whether we are in <em|display style>
    or not. Formulas which occur on separate lines like

    <\equation*>
      <frac|n|H(\<alpha\><rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,\<alpha\><rsub|n>)>=<frac|1|\<alpha\><rsub|1>>+\<cdots\>+<frac|1|\<alpha\><rsub|n>>
    </equation*>

    are usually typeset in display style, contrary to inline formulas like
    <with|mode|math|<frac|n|H(\<alpha\><rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,\<alpha\><rsub|n>)>=<frac|1|\<alpha\><rsub|1>>+\<cdots\>+<frac|1|\<alpha\><rsub|n>>>.
    As you notice, formulas in display style are rendered using a wider
    spacing. The display style is disabled in several mathematical constructs
    such as scripts, fractions, binomial coefficients, and so on. As a
    result, the double numerators in the formula

    <\equation*>
      H(\<alpha\><rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,\<alpha\><rsub|n>)=<frac|n|<frac|1|\<alpha\><rsub|1>>+\<cdots\>+<frac|1|\<alpha\><rsub|n>>>
    </equation*>

    are typeset in a smaller font. You may override the default settings
    using <menu|Format|Display style>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|math-condensed|false><explain-synopsis|condensed display style>
  <|explain>
    By default, formulas like <with|mode|math|a+\<cdots\>+z> are typeset
    using a nice, wide spacing around the <with|mode|math|<op|+>> symbol. In
    formulas with scripts like <with|mode|math|\<mathe\><rsup|a+\<cdots\>+z>+\<mathe\><rsup|\<alpha\>+\<cdots\>+\<zeta\>>>
    the readability is further enhanced by using a more condensed spacing
    inside the scripts: this helps the reader to distinguish symbols
    occurring in the scripts from symbols occurring at the ground level when
    the scripts are long. The default behaviour can be overridden using
    <menu|Format|Condensed>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <var-val|math-vpos|0><explain-synopsis|position in fractions>
  <|explain>
    For a high quality typesetting of fraction, it is good to avoid
    subscripts in numerators to descend to low and superscripts in
    denominators to ascend to high. <TeXmacs> therefore provides an
    additional environment variable <src-var|math-vpos> which takes the value
    <with|mode|math|1> inside numerators, <with|mode|math|\<um\>1> inside
    denominators and <with|mode|math|0> otherwise. In order to see the effect
    the different settings, consider the following formula:

    <\equation*>
      <with|math-vpos|-1|<group|a<rsub|\<um\>1><rsup|2>>>+<with|math-vpos|0|<group|a<rsub|0><rsup|2>>>+<with|math-vpos|1|<group|a<rsub|1><rsup|2>>>
    </equation*>

    <\tm-fragment>
      <with|mode|math|<inactive*|<with|math-vpos|-1|<group|<active*|a<rsub|\<um\>1><rsup|2>>>>+<with|math-vpos|0|<group|<active*|a<rsub|0><rsup|2>>>>+<with|math-vpos|1|<group|<active*|a<rsub|1><rsup|2>>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    In this example, the grouping is necessary in order to let the different
    vertical positions take effect on each
    <with|mode|math|a<rsub|i><rsup|2>>. Indeed, the vertical position is
    uniform for each horizontal concatenation.

<TeXmacs|1.99.1>

<style|tmdoc>

  <tmdoc-title|The <TeXmacs> content model>

  All <TeXmacs> documents or document fragments can be thought of as
  <em|trees>, as explained in more detail in the chapter about the
  <hlink|<TeXmacs> document format|../../format/basics/basics.en.tm>. Inside
  <scheme> programs, there are two main ways to represent such trees,
  depending on whether one manipulates active or passive documents:

  <paragraph*|Passive documents and <scheme> trees><label|tree-passive>

  Passive documents, like those which are processed by a<nbsp>conversion
  tool, are usually represented by <em|scheme trees>. For instance, the
  fraction

  <\equation*>
    <frac|a<rsup|2>|b+c>
  </equation*>

  is typically represented by

  <\scm-code>
    (frac (concat "a" (rsup "2")) "b+c")
  </scm-code>

  This representation is convenient in the sense that they can be manipulated
  directly using standard <scheme> routines on lists.

  <paragraph*|Active documents and C++ trees><label|tree-active>

  Active documents, like ones which are visible in one of the editors
  windows, are rather represented using the internal C++ type
  <verbatim|tree>, which has been exported to <scheme> via the glue. When a
  tree is part of a real document inside the editor, the tree is aware about
  its position inside the document. Using routines from the tree API, you may
  then make changes in the document simply by assigning new values to the
  tree.

  For instance, consider the following experiment: open two windows and start
  a <scheme> session in each window. In the second window, enter the lines

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|scheme] >
      (use-modules (utils library tree))
    </input>

    <\input|scheme] >
      (define t (buffer-tree))
    </input>
  </session>

  In the first window, you may now modify the document in the second window
  using commands like

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|scheme] >
      (tree-set! t (tree 'document (string-\<gtr\>tree "First line.")

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (string-\<gtr\>tree
      "Second line.")))
    </input>

    <\input|scheme] >
      (tree-set t 1 (string-\<gtr\>tree "New second line."))
    </input>

    <\input|scheme] >
      (tree-set t 0 (tree 'strong (tree-ref t 0)))
    </input>
  </session>

  <paragraph*|A common framework><label|tree-hybrid>

  From the last three lines in above experiment, it becomes apparent that it
  is quite cumbersome to manipulate trees using the standard tree
  constructors. For this reason, <TeXmacs> provides a hybrid type
  <verbatim|content> for manipulating scheme trees and C++ trees in a common
  framework. For instance, the last three lines in the above experiment may
  be replaced by

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|scheme] >
      (tree-set! t '(document "First line." "Second line."))
    </input>

    <\input|scheme] >
      (tree-set t 1 "New second line.")
    </input>

    <\input|scheme] >
      (tree-set t 0 `(strong ,(tree-ref t 0)))
    </input>
  </session>

  More precisely, a scheme expression of the type <verbatim|content> is
  either a string, a tree or a list whose first element is a symbol and whose
  remaining elements are other expressions of type <verbatim|content>.
  <TeXmacs> provides several routines (usually prefixed by <verbatim|tm->)
  for basic operations on content, like <scm|tm-car>, <scm|tm-arity>,
  <scm|tm-\<gtr\>list>, <scm|tm-equal?>, etc. Most higher level routines are
  built on top of these routines, so as to accept arguments of type
  <verbatim|content> whenever appropriate.

  <paragraph*|Persistent positions inside trees>

  Besides the fact that trees remember their <em|positions> inside the global
  edit tree, it is also possible to create cursor positions inside the global
  edit tree, which are naturally updated when modifications take place. This
  technique is useful when you want to write an editing routine which does
  not act locally at the cursor position. For instance, the following routine
  can be used to insert content at the start of the current buffer in a
  reliable way:

  <\scm-code>
    (define (insert-at-buffer-start t)

    \ \ (with-cursor (path-start (root-tree) (buffer-path))

    \ \ \ \ (insert t)))
  </scm-code>

  The <scm|with-cursor> macro temporarily changes the cursor position, while
  storing the old cursor position in such a way that it will be updated
  during changes of the document. The user may also use the more explicit
  routines <scm|position-new>, <scm|position-delete>, <scm|position-set> and
  <scm|position-get> to manage persistent positions.

  <tmdoc-title|Writing your own plug-ins>

  In order to write a plug-in <verbatim|<em|myplugin>>, you should start by
  creating a directory

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/<em|myplugin>
  </verbatim>

  where to put all your files (recall that <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH>
  defaults to <verbatim|$HOME/.TeXmacs>). In addition, you may create the
  following subdirectories (when needed):

  <\description-dash>
    <item*|<verbatim|bin>>For binary files.

    <item*|<verbatim|doc>>For documentation (not yet supported).

    <item*|<verbatim|langs>>For language related files, such as dictionaries
    (not yet supported).

    <item*|<verbatim|lib>>For libraries.

    <item*|<verbatim|packages>>For style packages.

    <item*|<verbatim|progs>>For <value|scheme> programs.

    <item*|<verbatim|src>>For source files.

    <item*|<verbatim|styles>>For style files.
  </description-dash>

  As a general rule, files which are present in these subdirectories will be
  automatically recognized by <TeXmacs> at startup. For instance, if you
  provide a <verbatim|bin> subdirectory, then

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/<em|myplugin>/bin
  </verbatim>

  will be automatically added to the <verbatim|PATH> environment variable at
  startup. Notice that the subdirectory structure of a plug-in is very
  similar to the subdirectory structure of <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH>.

  <\example>
    The easiest type of plug-in only consists of data files, such as a
    collection of style files and packages. In order to create such a
    plug-in, it suffices to create directories

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/<em|myplugin>

      \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/<em|myplugin>/styles

      \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/<em|myplugin>/packages
    </verbatim>

    and to put your style files and packages in the last two directories.
    After restarting <TeXmacs>, your style files and packages will
    automatically appear in the <menu|Document|Style> and <menu|Document|Use
    package> menus.
  </example>

  For more complex plug-ins, such as plug-ins with additional <value|scheme>
  or <value|cpp> code, one usually has to provide a <value|scheme>
  configuration file

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/<em|myplugin>/progs/init-<em|myplugin>.scm
  </verbatim>

  This configuration file should contain an instruction of the following form

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (plugin-configure <em|myplugin>

    \ \ <em|configuration-options>)
  </scheme-fragment>

  Here the <verbatim|<em|configuration-options>> describe the principal
  actions which have to be undertaken at startup, including sanity checks for
  the plug-in. In the next sections, we will describe some simple examples of
  plug-ins and their configuration. Many other examples can be found in the
  directories

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/examples/plugins

    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/plugins
  </verbatim>

  Some of these are <hyper-link|described|../interface/interface.en.tm> in
  more detail in the chapter about writing new interfaces.

  <tmdoc-title|Semantics of mathematical symbols>

  The mathematical symbols in <TeXmacs> all come with a certain number of
  properties which correspond to their intended meaning. For instance,
  <TeXmacs> is aware that <math|<op|+>> is an infix operator, whereas ! is
  rather a postfix, and , a separator.

  <TeXmacs> has special symbols <math|\<mathe\>=2.71828\<cdots\>>,
  <math|\<mathpi\>=3.14159\<cdots\>> and <math|\<mathi\>> for important
  mathematical constants, which display differently from the mere characters
  <math|e>, <math|\<pi\>> and <math|i>, and which can be entered using the
  shortcuts <shortcut|\<mathe\>>, <shortcut|\<mathpi\>> and
  <shortcut|\<mathi\>>. We recommend to systematically use these shortcuts.

  Inversely, semantically distinct symbols may display in a similar way. For
  instance, the comma separator, as in <math|f<around|(|x,y|)>>, is different
  from the decimal comma, as in <math|3\<comma\>14159\<cdots\>>. Notice that
  the two symbols admit different spacing rules. Semantically distinct
  symbols which are rendered by the same glyph are called <em|homoglyphs>.
  Notice that our semantics is purely syntactic: for instance,
  the<nbsp><math|+> infix is commonly used for addition, but sometimes also
  for the concatenation of strings. Nevertheless, these two uses do not
  differ from a syntactical point of view, since the<nbsp><math|+> symbol
  remains a binary infix with the same precedence with respect to other
  symbols.

  The most confusing homoglyphs are the various invisible symbols supported
  by <TeXmacs>:

  <\itemize>
    <item>The multiplication, entered by <key|*>. Example: <math|a*b>.

    <item>Function application, entered by <key|space>. Example: <math|sin
    x>.

    <item>An invisible separator, entered by <shortcut|\<nocomma\>>. Example:
    the matrix <math|A=<around|(|a<rsub|i\<nocomma\>j>|)>>.

    <item>An invisible addition, entered by <shortcut|\<noplus\>>. Example:
    <math|17\<noplus\><frac*|3|8>>.

    <item>An invisible symbol, entered by <shortcut|\<nosymbol\>>. Example:
    the increment <math|\<nosymbol\>+1>.

    <item><label|nobracket>An invisible bracket (mainly for internal use). A
    matching pair of invisible brackets is entered using <key|( var>.
  </itemize>

  Again it is recommended that authors carefully enter these various
  invisible symbols when appropriate. It is particularly important to
  distinguish between multiplication and function application, since there is
  no 100% safe automatic way to make this distinction (we already mentioned
  the formulas <math|a<around|(|b+c|)>> and <math|f<around|(|x+y|)>> before).

  <TeXmacs> supports two quite general schemes for entering homoglyphs. On
  the one hand, we often rely on the standard variant system. For instance,
  <math|\<times\>> and <math|\<ast\>> are obtained using <shortcut|\<times\>>
  and <shortcut|\<ast\>>. In table<nbsp><reference|homoglyph-table> we have
  given the complete list of homoglyphs supported by <TeXmacs>.

  <\scm-fragment>
    (<em|key-combination> <scm-arg|action_1> ... <scm-arg|action_n>)

    (<em|key-combination> <scm-arg|result>)

    (<em|key-combination> <scm-arg|result> <scm-arg|help-message>)
  </scm-fragment>

  In the first case, the <scm-arg|action_i> are <scheme> commands associated
  to the string <scm-arg|key-combination>. In the second and third case,
  <scm-arg|result> is a string which is to be inserted in the text when the
  <scm-arg|key-combination> has been completed. An optional
  <scm-arg|help-message> may be displayed when the <scm-arg|key-combination>
  is finished.

  <tmdoc-title|Entering titles and abstracts>

  The <tmdtd|header-title> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides tags for entering
  information about the entire document. The two top-level tags are

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-data|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>>
    Specify data attached to your document (title, authors, <abbr|etc.>; see
    below) and render the title.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|abstract|body>>
    The abstract for your paper.
  </explain>

  When creating a <markup|doc-data> tag using <menu|Insert|Title|Insert
  title>, <TeXmacs> automatically inserts a <markup|doc-title> tag as its
  first arguments. New data may be inserted from the <menu|Insert|Title>
  menu. Each child <src-arg|data-1>, <math|\<ldots\>>, <src-arg|data-n> of
  the <markup|doc-data> tag is of one of the following forms:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-title|title>>
    Specify the <src-arg|title> of the document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-subtitle|subtitle>>
    Specify the <src-arg|subtitle> of the document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-author|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>>
    Specify datas for one of the authors of the document (name, affiliation,
    <abbr|etc.>; see below).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-date|date>>
    The creation date of the document. In particular you may take
    <inactive*|<date>> for the value of <src-arg|date> for the current date.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-running-title|title>>
    Specify a running <src-arg|title> for your document which may be used in
    page headers.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-running-author|author>>
    Specify a running <src-arg|author> for your document which may be used in
    page headers.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-keywords|kw-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|kw-n>>
    Specify keywords <src-arg|kw-1> until <src-arg|kw-n> for your document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-msc|nr-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|nr-n>>
    Specify <abbr|A.M.S.> subject classification numbers <src-arg|nr-1> until
    <src-arg|nr-n> for your document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-note|note>>
    A note about your document. In particular, you may take
    <inactive*|<with-TeXmacs-text>> for the value of <src-arg|note> in order
    to indicate that your document has been written using <TeXmacs>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-data|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>>
    Specify structured datas for one of the authors of the document (name,
    affiliation, <abbr|etc.>; see below).
  </explain>

  When inserting an additional author using <menu|Insert|Title|Author|Insert
  author>, <TeXmacs> inserts a <explain-macro|doc-author|<with|font-shape|right|<explain-macro|author-data|...>>>
  tree with an <markup|author-name> tag as its first argument. New author
  data may be inserted from the <menu|Insert|Title|Author> menu. Each child
  <src-arg|data-1>, <math|\<ldots\>>, <src-arg|data-n> of the
  <markup|author-data> tag is of one of the following forms:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-name|name>>
    Specify the <src-arg|name> of the author.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-affiliation|affiliation>>
    The <src-arg|affiliation> of the author.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-email|email>>
    An <src-arg|email> address for the author.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-homepage|homepage>>
    The <src-arg|homepage> of the author.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-note|note>>
    A miscellanous <src-arg|note> attached to the author, like a thank-word.
  </explain>

  As a general rule, the use of any of the subtags of <markup|doc-data> or
  <markup|author-data> is optional. An individual subtag may also be
  specified several times. This is useful for documents with several authors,
  or authors with several addresses. The rendering of title information is
  very style-dependent: some styles render addresses in a single line or even
  as a footnote, where other styles use a more widely spaced presentation.
  Often, some information like keywords or AMS subject classification numbers
  are only rendered as a part of the abstract.

  <tmdoc-title|Cut and paste>

  You can select text and formulas by maintaining the left mouse button. In
  order to delete the selected region, use <menu|Edit|Cut>. In order to copy
  the selected region, first click on <menu|Edit|Copy>. Next, paste it as
  many times as you want to the location of your cursor, using
  <menu|Edit|Paste>. Alternatively, you may copy a selected region using the
  middle mouse button.

  It is also possible to the change text properties of a selected region. For
  instance, in order to transform some black text in red, you select it using
  the left mouse button and click on <menu|Format|Color|Red>. Similarly, if you
  select a formula and you click on <menu|Insert|Fraction>, then
  the formula becomes the numerator of some fraction.

  When using the copy and paste mechanism to communicate with other
  applications, text is copied and pasted using the <TeXmacs> data format.
  You may specify other import and export formats using <menu|Edit|Import>
  resp. <menu|Edit|Export>. By default, copying and pasting uses the primary
  text buffer. Using <menu|Edit|Copy to> and <menu|Edit|Paste from>, you may
  specify as many other buffers as you like.

  There are two ways to make selections using the keyboard. When using the
  cursor keys <key|left>, <key|right>, <abbr|etc.> while holding
  down the <prefix|S-> button, you may select text while moving around
  the cursor. Alternatively, you may press <shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> once to fix a
  starting position. When moving around using the cursor keys, the text
  between the starting position and the current position keeps being
  selected. The selection gets cleared when pressing <shortcut|(selection-cancel)>.

  Notice that the <shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> shortcut also allows you to make
  <em|structured selections>. You may select the current word you are in by
  pressing<nbsp><shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> twice. Each additional time you press
  <shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> results in the selection of the smallest structure
  which englobes the current selection. Ultimately, when the entire document
  gets selected, pressing <shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> once more clears the selection.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Flows>

  Complex documents often contain footnotes or floating objects, which appear
  differently on pages as the main text. In fact, the content of such complex
  documents use several <with|font shape|italic|flows>, one for the main
  text, one for the footnotes, one for floats, and still another one for two
  column text. The different flows are broken across pages in a quite
  independent way.

  In order to insert a footnote, you may use <subsubmenu|Format|page
  insertion|footnote>. The number of columns of the text may be changed in
  <submenu|Paragraph|number of columns>.

  <tmdoc-title|Tab-completion>

  By default, <TeXmacs> looks into your document for possible
  tab-completions. Inside sessions for your application, you might wish to
  customize this behaviour, so as to complete built-in commands. In order to
  do this, you have to specify the configuration option

  <\scm-code>
    (:tab-completion #t)
  </scm-code>

  in your <verbatim|init-<em|myplugin>.scm> file, so that <TeXmacs> will send
  special tab-completion requests to your application whenever you press
  <key|tab> inside a session. These commands are of the form

  <\quotation>
    <\framed-fragment>
      <\verbatim>
        <render-key|DATA_COMMAND>(complete <em|input-string>
        <em|cursor-position>)<shortcut|(kbd-return)>
      </verbatim>
    </framed-fragment>
  </quotation>

  Here <verbatim|DATA_COMMAND> stands for the special character
  <verbatim|'\\20'> (ASCII 16). The <verbatim|<em|input-string>> is the
  complete string in which the <key|tab> occurred and the
  <verbatim|<em|cursor-position>> is an integer which specifies the position
  of the cursor when you pressed <key|tab>. <TeXmacs> expects your
  application to return a tuple with all possible tab-completions of the form

  <\quotation>
    <\framed-fragment>
      <verbatim|<render-key|DATA_BEGIN>scheme:(tuple <em|root>
      <em|completion-1> ><math|\<cdots\>><verbatim|
      <em|completion-n>)><render-key|DATA_END>
    </framed-fragment>
  </quotation>

  Here <verbatim|<em|root>> corresponds to a substring before the cursor for
  which completions could be found. The strings <verbatim|<em|completion-1>>
  until <verbatim|<em|completion-n>> are the list of completions as they
  might be inserted at the current cursor position. If no completions could
  be found, then you may also return the empty string.

  <\remark>
    In principle, the tab-completion mechanism should still work in
    mathematical input mode. In that case, the <verbatim|<em|input-string>>
    will correspond to the serialization of the <TeXmacs> input.
  </remark>

  <\remark>
    The way <TeXmacs> sends commands to your application can be customized in
    a similar way as for the input: we provide a <scm|:commander>
    configuration option for this, which works in a similar way as the
    <scm|:serializer> option.
  </remark>

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|complete> plug-in>

  A very rudimentary example of how the tab-completion mechanism works is
  given by the <verbatim|complete> plug-in, which consists of the following
  files:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|complete/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|complete/progs/init-complete.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|complete/src/complete.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  The startup banner in <verbatim|complete.cpp> takes care of part of the
  configuration:

  <\cpp-code>
    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "verbatim:";

    format_plugin ();

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "We know how to complete 'h'";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    fflush (stdout);
  </cpp-code>

  Here <cpp|format_plugin> is given by

  <\cpp-code>
    void

    format_plugin () {

    \ \ // The configuration of a plugin can be completed at startup time.

    \ \ // This may be interesting for adding tab-completion a posteriori.

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "command:";

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> "(plugin-configure complete (:tab-completion
    #t))";

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    }
  </cpp-code>

  In the main loop, we first deal with regular input:

  <\cpp-code>
    char buffer[100];

    cin.getline (buffer, 100, '\\n');

    if (buffer[0] != DATA_COMMAND) {

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "verbatim:";

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> "You typed " \<less\>\<less\> buffer;

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    }
  </cpp-code>

  We next treat the case when a tab-completion command is sent to the
  application:

  <\cpp-code>
    else {

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "scheme:";

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> "(tuple \\"h\\" \\"ello\\" \\"i there\\"
    \\"ola\\" \\"opsakee\\")";

    \ \ cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    }

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  As you notice, the actual command is ignored, so our example is really very
  rudimentary.

  <tmdoc-title|Writing documentation>

  Documentation for your plug-in <verbatim|myplugin> should be put in the
  <verbatim|doc> subdirectory of the main directory <verbatim|myplugin>. We
  recommend to write at least the following three documentation files:

  <\description-long>
    <item*|<verbatim|myplugin.en.tm>>This file should mainly contain a
    <markup|traverse> tag with links to the other documentation files, as
    described in the section ``<hlink|traversing the <TeXmacs>
    documentation|$TEXMACS_DOC_PATH/about/contribute/documentation/traversal.en.tm>''.

    <item*|<verbatim|myplugin-abstract.en.tm>>This file should contain a
    short description of the purpose of the plugin-in. If appropriate, then
    you should also describe how to get the plug-in and how to install it.
    The contents of this file should also be suitable for publication on the
    web site of <TeXmacs>.

    <item*|<verbatim|myplugin-demo.en.tm>>This file should contain a short
    demonstration of your plug-in, such as an example session.
  </description-long>

  The first two files are mandatory, if you want your plug-in to show up in
  the <menu|Help|Plug-ins> menu. Please refrain from putting too many images
  in the documentation files, so as to keep the size of the documentation
  reasonable when integrated into the main <TeXmacs> distribution.

  <tmdoc-title|Remote plug-ins>

  It sometimes happens that certain plug-ins are only installed on a remote
  computer. In many cases, it will still be possible to use such a plug-in
  inside <TeXmacs> over an <hlink|SSH|http://www.openssh.com/> connection.

  In order to make this work, you first have to make sure that SSH is
  installed on both computers and that connecting by SSH to the remote
  machine can be done automatically, without having to type a password. This
  can be done by copying your public identity on the local server to the
  remote server into the file <verbatim|~/.ssh/authorized_keys>; see the
  documentation on SSH for more information.

  As the next step, you have to make sure that <TeXmacs> has been installed
  on both computers. The remote <TeXmacs> installation will mainly be used in
  order to detect which plug-ins can be used on the remote computer.

  When everything has been set up correctly in this way, select
  <menu|Insert|Session|Remote> in order to open the remote plug-in selector.
  Add the name of the remote server by typing its name or IP address and
  clicking on <menu|Add>. After a small pause, the remote server should
  appear in the list together with the remote plug-ins which are supported.
  You may now simply select the plug-in you want to use from the list. Notice
  that remote plug-ins may take a few seconds in order to boot. Please be
  patient while booting is in progress.

  Servers which have been added to the list of remote plug-in servers will be
  remembered at the next time when you start <TeXmacs>. You may use the
  buttons <menu|Remove> and <menu|Update> in order to remove a server from
  the list and to redetermine the list of supported remote plug-ins.

  <tmdoc-title|Default serialization>

  Documents are generally written to disk using the standard <TeXmacs> syntax
  (which corresponds to the <verbatim|.tm> and <verbatim|.ts> file
  extensions). This syntax is designed to be unobtrusive and easy to read, so
  the content of a document can be easily understood from a plain text
  editor. For instance, the formula (<reference|tm-tree-ex>) is represented
  by

  <\quote-env>
    <framed-fragment|<verbatim|\<less\>with\|mode\|math\|x+y+\<less\>frac\|1\|2\<gtr\>+\<less\>sqrt\|y+z\<gtr\>\<gtr\>>>
  </quote-env>

  On the other hand, <TeXmacs> syntax makes style files difficult to read and
  is not designed to be hand-edited: whitespace has complex semantics and
  some internal structures are not obviously presented. Do not edit documents
  (and especially style files) in the <TeXmacs> syntax unless you know what
  you are doing.

  <paragraph*|Main serialization principle>

  The <TeXmacs> format uses the special characters <verbatim|\<less\>>,
  <verbatim|\|>, <verbatim|\<gtr\>>, <verbatim|\\> and <verbatim|/> in order
  to serialize trees. By default, a tree like

  <\equation>
    <label|gen-tree-tm><tree|f|x<rsub|1>|\<cdots\>|x<rsub|n>>
  </equation>

  is serialized as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <verbatim|\<less\>f\|x<rsub|1>\|...\|x<rsub|n>\<gtr\>>
  </tm-fragment>

  If one of the arguments <with|mode|math|x<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,x<rsub|n>> is a
  multi-paragraph tree (which means in this context that it contains a
  <markup|document> tag or a <markup|collection> tag), then an alternative
  long form is used for the serialization. If <verbatim|f> takes only
  multi-paragraph arguments, then the tree would be serialized as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
      <\verbatim>
        \<less\>\\f\<gtr\>

        \ \ x<rsub|1>

        \<less\>\|f\<gtr\>

        \ \ ...

        \<less\>\|f\<gtr\>

        \ \ x<rsub|n>

        \<less\>/f\<gtr\>
      </verbatim>
    </with>
  </tm-fragment>

  In general, arguments which are not multi-paragraph are serialized using
  the short form. For instance, if <verbatim|n=5> and <verbatim|x<rsub|3>>
  and <verbatim|x<rsub|5>> are multi-paragraph, but not <verbatim|x<rsub|1>,>
  <verbatim|x<rsub|2>> and <verbatim|x<rsub|4>>, then
  (<reference|gen-tree-tm>) is serialized as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
      <\verbatim>
        \<less\>\\f\|x<rsub|1>\|x<rsub|2>\<gtr\>

        \ \ x<rsub|3>

        \<less\>\|f\|x<rsub|4>\<gtr\>

        \ \ x<rsub|5>

        \<less\>/f\<gtr\>
      </verbatim>
    </with>
  </tm-fragment>

  The escape sequences <verbatim|\\\<less\>>, <verbatim|\\\|>,
  <verbatim|\\\<gtr\>> and <verbatim|\\\\> may be used to represent the
  characters <verbatim|\<less\>>, <verbatim|\|>, <verbatim|\<gtr\>> and
  <verbatim|\\>. For instance, <with|mode|math|\<alpha\>+\<beta\>> is
  serialized as <verbatim|\\\<less\>alpha\\\<gtr\>+\\\<less\>beta\\\<gtr\>>.

  <paragraph*|Formatting and whitespace>

  The <markup|document> and <markup|concat> primitives are serialized in a
  special way. The <markup|concat> primitive is serialized as usual
  concatenation. For instance, the text ``an <em|important> note'' is
  serialized as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
      <\verbatim>
        an \<less\>em\|important\<gtr\> note
      </verbatim>
    </with>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <markup|document> tag is serialized by separating successive paragraphs
  by double newline characters. For instance, the quotation

  <\quote-env>
    Ik ben de blauwbilgorgel.

    Als ik niet wok of worgel,
  </quote-env>

  is serialized as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
      <\verbatim>
        \<less\>\\quote-env\<gtr\>

        \ \ Ik ben de blauwbilgorgel.

        \;

        \ \ Als ik niet wok of worgel,

        \<less\>/quote-env\<gtr\>
      </verbatim>
    </with>
  </tm-fragment>

  Notice that whitespace at the beginning and end of paragraphs is ignored.
  Inside paragraphs, any amount of whitespace is considered as a single
  space. Similarly, more than two newline characters are equivalent to two
  newline characters. For instance, the quotation might have been stored on
  disk as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
      <\verbatim>
        \<less\>\\quote-env\<gtr\>

        \ \ Ik ben de \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ blauwbilgorgel.

        \;

        \;

        \ \ Als ik niet wok of \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ worgel,

        \<less\>/quote-env\<gtr\>
      </verbatim>
    </with>
  </tm-fragment>

  The space character may be explicitly represented through the escape
  sequence ``<verbatim|\\ >''. Empty paragraphs are represented using the
  escape sequence ``<verbatim|\\;>''.

  <paragraph*|Raw data>

  The <markup|raw-data> primitive is used inside <TeXmacs> for the
  representation of binary data, like image files included into the document.
  Such binary data is serialized as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
      <\verbatim>
        \<less\>#<em|binary-data>\<gtr\>
      </verbatim>
    </with>
  </tm-fragment>

  where the <verbatim|<em|binary-data>> is a string of hexadecimal numbers
  which represents a string of bytes.

  <tmdoc-title|Environments>

  In a similar way as content-based tags, environments are used to mark
  portions of text with a special meaning. However, while
  <hlink|content-based tags|man-content-tags.en.tm> usually enclose small
  portions of text, environments often enclose portions that are several
  paragraphs long. Frequently used environments in mathematics are
  <markup|theorem> and <markup|proof>, like in the example below:

  <\theorem>
    There exist no positive integers <math|a>, <math|b>, <math|c> and
    <math|n> with <math|n\<geqslant\>3>, such that
    <math|a<rsup|n>+b<rsup|n>=c<rsup|n>>.
  </theorem>

  <\proof>
    I do not have room here to write the proof down.
  </proof>

  You may enter environments using <menu|Insert|Environment>. Other
  environments with a similar rendering as theorems are <markup|proposition>,
  <markup|lemma>, <markup|corollary>, <markup|axiom>, <markup|definition>.
  You may use the <markup|dueto> macro (entered using <key|\\ d u e t o
  return>) in order to specify the person(s) to which the theorem is due,
  like in

  <\theorem>
    <dueto|Pythagoras>Under nice circumstances, we have
    <math|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>>.
  </theorem>

  Other frequently used environments with a similar rendering as theorems,
  but which do not emphasize the enclosed text, are <markup|remark>,
  <markup|note>, <markup|example>, <markup|warning>, <markup|exercise> and
  <markup|problem>. The remaining environments <markup|verbatim>,
  <markup|code>, <markup|quote>, <markup|quotation> and <markup|verse> can be
  used in order to enter multiparagraph text or code, quotations or poetry.

  <tmdoc-title|Porting <TeXmacs> to other platforms>

  Currently, <TeXmacs> is supported on most major Unix/X-Window platforms and
  a Windows port should be ready soon. Nevertheless, your help is appreciated
  in order to keep the existing ports working. Some remaining challenges for
  porting <TeXmacs> are:

  <\itemize>
    <item>A native port for MacOS-X.

    <item>Ports to PDAs, first of all those which run Linux. It should be
    noticed that, with the current support for <name|Freetype>, <TeXmacs> no
    longer depends on <TeX>/<LaTeX> for its fonts. We expect it to be
    possible to obtain a reasonable ports for <TeXmacs> on PDAs with 32Mb and
    at least 100MHz clock-speed. Of course, one also needs to customize the
    menus and/or icon bars, but this should not be hard.

    <TeXmacs> ports to PDAs would be particularly interesting in combination
    with the available plug-ins for doing scientific computations.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Supporting your system inside <apply|TeXmacs>>

  Assume that you have successfully written a first interface with
  <apply|TeXmacs> as explained in the previous section. Then it is time now
  to include support for your system in the standard <apply|TeXmacs>
  distribution, after which further improvements can be made.

  From version 1.0.1.5 on, it has become quite easy to adapt your interface
  in such a way that it can be directly integrated into <TeXmacs>. The idea
  is to create a directory:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/myplugin
  </verbatim>

  where <verbatim|myplugin> is the name of your plugin. Here we recall that
  <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH> is bound to <verbatim|~/.TeXmacs>, by
  default. In the directory <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/plugins> you can find all
  standard plugins, which are shipped with your <TeXmacs> distribution. These
  provide good examples which you may imitate.

  The above <verbatim|myplugin> directory should contain a similar
  subdirectory structure as <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH> itself, but you may omit
  directories which you do not actually use. In any case, you need to provide
  a file <verbatim|progs/init-myplugin.scm> which describes how to initialize
  your plugin. Usually, this file contains just one <name|Scheme> instruction
  of the following form:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ (plugin-configure myplugin<format|next line> \ \ \ \ \ (:require
    (file-in-path "myplugin"))<format|next line> \ \ \ \ \ (:launch
    "shell-cmd")<format|next line> \ \ \ \ \ (:format "input-format"
    "output-format")<format|next line> \ \ \ \ \ (:session "Myplugin"))
  </verbatim>

  The first instruction is a predicate which checks whether your plugin can
  be used on a particular system. Usually, it tests whether a certain program
  is available in the path. The remainder of the instructions is only
  executed if the requirement is fulfilled. The <verbatim|:launch>
  instruction specifies that your plugin should be launched using
  <verbatim|shell-cmd>. The command <verbatim|shell-cmd> is usually of the
  form <verbatim|myplugin --texmacs>. The <verbatim|:format> instruction
  specifies which formats are used for the input and output. Usually, the
  <verbatim|input-format> is <verbatim|verbatim> and the
  <verbatim|output-format> is <verbatim|generic>. Other available formats are
  <verbatim|scheme>, <verbatim|latex>, <verbatim|html> and <verbatim|ps>. The
  <verbatim|:session> instruction makes shell sessions available for your
  plugin from the menu <apply|menu|Insert|Session|Myplugin>.

  If everything works well, and you wish to make it possible for others to
  use your system inside the official <apply|TeXmacs> distribution, then
  contact me at <verbatim|vdhoeven@texmacs.org>.

  <tmdoc-title|Sending commands to <TeXmacs>>

  The application may use <verbatim|command> as a very particular output
  format in order to send <scheme> commands to <TeXmacs>. In other words, the
  block

  <\quotation>
    <framed-fragment|<verbatim|<render-key|DATA_BEGIN>command:<em|cmd><render-key|DATA_END>>>
  </quotation>

  will send the command <verbatim|<em|cmd>> to <TeXmacs>. Such commands are
  executed immediately after reception of <render-key|DATA_END>. We also
  recall that such command blocks may be incorporated recursively in larger
  <render-key|DATA_BEGIN>-<render-key|DATA_END> blocks.

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|menus> plug-in>

  The <verbatim|nested> plug-in shows how an application can modify the
  <TeXmacs> menus in an interactive way. The plug-in consists of the files

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|menus/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|menus/progs/init-menus.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|menus/src/menus.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  The body of the main loop of <verbatim|menus.cpp> simply contains

  <\cpp-code>
    char buffer[100];

    cin.getline (buffer, 100, '\\n');

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "verbatim:";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "command:(menus-add
    \\""

    \ \ \ \ \ \<less\>\<less\> buffer \<less\>\<less\> "\\")"
    \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "Added " \<less\>\<less\> buffer \<less\>\<less\> "
    to menu";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  The <scheme> macro <scm|menus-add> is defined in <verbatim|init-menus.scm>:

  <\scm-code>
    (define menu-items '("Hi"))

    \;

    (tm-menu (menus-menu)

    \ \ (for (entry menu-items)

    \ \ \ \ ((eval entry) (insert entry))))

    \;

    (tm-define (menus-add entry)

    \ \ (set! menu-items (cons entry menu-items)))

    \;

    (plugin-configure menus

    \ \ (:require (url-exists-in-path? "menus.bin"))

    \ \ (:launch "menus.bin")

    \ \ (:session "Menus"))

    \;

    (menu-bind plugin-menu

    \ \ (:require (in-menus?))

    \ \ (=\<gtr\> "Menus" (link menus-menu)))
  </scm-code>

  The configuration of <verbatim|menus> proceeds as usual:

  <\scm-code>
    (plugin-configure menus

    \ \ (:require (url-exists-in-path? "menus.bin"))

    \ \ (:launch "menus.bin")

    \ \ (:session "Menus"))

  <tmdoc-title|Incorporating mathematical formulas into documents>

  <TeXmacs> provides three main ways in order to enter a mathematical
  formulas into the main text:

  <\description>
    <item*|<menu|Insert|Mathematics|Inline formula> or <key|$>>

    This entry corresponds to small <em|inline formulas> like
    <math|a<rsup|2>+b<rsup|2>=c<rsup|2>> inside a textual paragraph. Note
    that formulas are typeset specially so they do not take too much vertical
    space. For example, limits are always displayed on the right. Limits can
    be displayed below in formulas with <menu|Format|Display style|on>. In
    formulas, formula style is off by default.

    <item*|<menu|Insert|Mathematics|Displayed formula> or
    <shortcut|(make-equation*)>>

    This entry is used for entering bigger <em|displayed equations>, like

    <\equation*>
      x<rsup|n>+y<rsup|n>=z<rsup|n>,
    </equation*>

    which are typeset in a paragraph of their own. You may use the shortcut
    <shortcut|(numbered-toggle (focus-tree))> in order to give the equation a
    number (or to remove the number of an equation). Also,
    <shortcut|(variant-circulate (focus-tree) #t)> allows you to switch
    between inline formulas and displayed equations.

    <item*|<menu|Insert|Mathematics|Several equations> or
    <shortcut|(make-eqnarray*)>>

    This entry allows you to create an <markup|eqnarray*>, a three columns
    wide table-like environment (see <hlink|creating
    tables|../table/man-create-table.en.tm>). This environment is typically
    used for lists of multiple relations like

    <\eqnarray*>
      <tformat|<table|<row|<cell|x+0>|<cell|=>|<cell|x>>|<row|<cell|x+<around|(|\<um\>x|)>>|<cell|=>|<cell|0>>|<row|<cell|x+y>|<cell|=>|<cell|y+x>>|<row|<cell|<around|(|x+y|)>+z>|<cell|=>|<cell|x+<around|(|y+z|)>>>>>
    </eqnarray*>

    The first column is centered to the right, the second one at the middle
    and the last one at the left. An other typical use of the
    <markup|eqnarray*> environment is a step by step computation

    <\eqnarray*>
      <tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<around*|(|\<mathe\><rsup|sin x>+sin
      \<mathe\><rsup|x>|)><rprime|'>>|<cell|=>|<cell|<around*|(|\<mathe\><rsup|sin
      x>|)><rprime|'>+<around*|(|sin \<mathe\><rsup|x>|)><rprime|'>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|=>|<cell|<around|(|sin
      x|)><rprime|'>*\<mathe\><rsup|sin x>+<around*|(|\<mathe\><rsup|x>|)><rprime|'>*sin
      \<mathe\><rsup|x>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|=>|<cell|\<mathe\><rsup|sin
      x>*cos x+\<mathe\><rsup|x>*sin \<mathe\><rsup|x>,>>>>
    </eqnarray*>

    in which many entries of the left column are left open.

  <tmdoc-title|Dynamic objects>

  Certain more complex objects can have several <em|states> during the
  editing process. Examples of such <em|dynamic objects> are labels and
  references, because the appearance of the reference depends on a
  dynamically determined number. Many other examples of dynamic markup can be
  found in the documentation about <hyper-link|writing style
  files|../../../devel/style/keyboard/style-kbd.en.tm>.

  When entering a dynamic object like a label using <shortcut|(make-label)>, the default
  state is <em|inactive>. This inactive state enables you to type the
  information which is relevant to the dynamic object, such as the name of
  the label in our case. Certain dynamic objects take an arbitrary number of
  parameters, and new ones can be inserted using <key|var>.

  <\big-figure>
    <with|color|blue|<with|mode|math|\<langle\>>label<with|mode|math|\|>>pythagoras<with|color|blue|<with|mode|math|\<rangle\>>>
  </big-figure|Inactive label>

  When you finished typing the relevant information for your dynamic object,
  you may type <shortcut|(kbd-return)> in order to <em|activate> the object. An
  active dynamic object may be deactivated by placing your cursor just behind
  the object and hitting <key|backspace>.

  <tmdoc-title|Writing your own initialization files>

  When starting up, <TeXmacs> executes the file

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/init-texmacs.scm
  </verbatim>

  as well as your personal initialization file

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/progs/my-init-texmacs.scm
  </verbatim>

  if it exists. By default, the path <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH> equals
  <verbatim|.TeXmacs>. Similarly, each time you create a new buffer (either
  by creating a new file or opening an already existing one), the file

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/init-buffer.scm
  </verbatim>

  is executed, as well as

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/progs/my-init-buffer.scm
  </verbatim>

  if it exists.

  <\example>
    Suppose you want to add a style package <verbatim|CustomStyle.ts> of your
    own to every new document you create. You can add the following lines to
    <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/progs/my-init-buffer.scm>:

    <\scm-code>
      (when (buffer-newly-created? (current-buffer))

      \ \ (set-style-list (append (get-style-list) '("CustomStyle")))

      \ \ (buffer-pretend-saved (current-buffer)))
    </scm-code>

    First we check whether the <scm|current-buffer> has been newly created in
    order not to apply the style to existing files when we open them. Then we
    add the new package (instead of changing it with <scm|init-style>) using
    <scm|set-style-list> and finally we call <scm|buffer-pretend-saved> to
    prevent <TeXmacs> from thinking the buffer has been modified by the
    change of style, or it would always prompt asking for confirmation before
    closing an empty buffer.
  </example>

  <tmdoc-title|Graphics interface between C++ and <value|scheme>>

  <paragraph*|Rationale>

  <TeXmacs> both implements a low-level part of the graphics in C++ and the
  high-level user interface in <value|scheme>. This API describes how both
  parts interact.

  The low-level C++ mainly takes care of transforming the graphical markup in
  a typesetted box. It also provides routines for translating between
  physical coordinates (relative to the window) into logical coordinates (the
  local coordinate system of the graphics) and routines for interacting with
  the typesetted boxes (finding the closest objects to a given point or
  region or projecting a point on a grid).

  <paragraph*|Definitions>

  <\description>
    <item*|Editor coordinates>The coordinates of the outermost typesetted
    box. Mouse events are typically passed in these coordinates. The
    corresponding data type is <verbatim|SI>.

    <item*|Graphics coordinates>The coordinates of the innermost graphics
    corresponding to the current cursor position.

    <item*|Grid>The current grid relative to the graphics for editing objects
    (this grid may theoretically be different from the grid which is
    displayed). The current grid consists both of a mathematical type of grid
    (no grid, cartesian grid, polar grid, etc.), together with special points
    which correspond either to control points, intersections of curves with
    the grid, intersections of curves, or self-intersections of curves.

    <item*|Grid point>A point on the grid is a triple <scm|(<scm-arg|p>
    <scm-arg|distance> <scm-arg|type>)>, where <scm-arg|p> is a point in
    graphics coordinates, <scm-arg|distance> its distance to the point which
    was projected on the grid (see <verbatim|grid-project> below) and
    <scm-arg|type> the type of grid point with a potential origin. For
    instance, <scm-arg|type> can be <verbatim|plain> or someting like
    <verbatim|(control t)> for a control point corresponding to the tree
    <scm|t> in the document.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Coordinate transformations>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(editor-\<gtr\>graphics <scm-arg|p>)><explain-synopsis|get graphics
    coordinates>
  <|explain>
    Transform a point <scm-arg|p> of the form <scm|(<scm-arg|x> <scm-arg|y>)>
    from the editor coordinates into the graphics coordinates.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(graphics-\<gtr\>editor p)><explain-synopsis|get editor coordinates>
  <|explain>
    Transform a point <scm-arg|p> of the form <scm|(<scm-arg|x> <scm-arg|y>)>
    from the graphics coordinates into the editor coordinates.
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Grid routines>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(grid-project <scm-arg|p>)><explain-synopsis|project point on grid>
  <|explain>
    Given a point <scm-arg|p> (in graphics coordinates), find its projection
    on \ the current grid, the <scm-arg|distance> part of the projection
    being the distance between <scm-arg|p> and its projection.

    Note: the routine grid-project can also be used in order to find editable
    shapes and groups close to the current pointer position. Indeed, the
    corresponding control points are understood to lie on the grid in our
    sense.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(grid-point-pertinence\<less\>? <scm-arg|p> <scm-arg|q>)>

    <scm|(grid-point-pertinence\<less\>=? <scm-arg|p>
    <scm-arg|q>)><explain-synopsis|order by pertinence>
  <|explain>
    Grid points are ordered by pertinence as a function of type and distance.
    For instance, control points have higher pertinence than plain grid
    points and closer grid points are considered better than farther ones.
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Selection of shapes>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(graphics-find-disk <scm-arg|p> <scm-arg|r>)><explain-synopsis|search
    shapes in disk>
  <|explain>
    Return the list of all trees in the graphics which intersect a disk with
    center <scm-arg|p> and radius <scm-arg|r> (in graphics coordinates).
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(graphics-find-rectangle <scm-arg|p>
    <scm-arg|q>)><explain-synopsis|search shapes in rectangle>
  <|explain>
    Return the list of all trees in the graphics which intersect a rectangle
    with corners <scm-arg|p> and <scm-arg|q> (in graphics coordinates).
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Computations with shapes>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(box-info t)><explain-synopsis|get bounding box for a shape>
  <|explain>
    \ Get a bounding box (and other information) about a shape <scm-arg|t>.
    <scm-arg|t> can be a tree or a scheme tree.
  </explain>

  <\remark>
    This section might be extended, since a lot of the graphical intelligence
    is implemented in the C++ code. For instance, we might want to compute
    the intersections of two curves inside the Scheme code. Also, when we
    will allow for user macros, we might want routines which return the
    graphical expansion of the macro (the constituent elementary shapes, i.e.
    polylines, splines, etc.).

  <tmdoc-title|Low level graphics manipulation>

  <paragraph*|Rationale>

  <TeXmacs> provides a small low-level library for the manipulation of
  graphics on top of the usual tree interface. One particularity of graphics
  operations is that they usually concern a large number of continuous
  changes (as a function of mouse movement) to one or more objects (under
  construction or being edited). On the one hand, this means that not all
  movements have to be undoable. On the other hand, this implies that some
  optimizations may be necessary to obtain a reasonable speed.

  For these reasons, the library allows the programmer to focus attention on
  one or several objects in a graphics and to quickly perform operations on
  these objects. Focus is mostly understood to be temporary: typically, the
  focus is released as soon as an operation has been completed, i.e. the
  construction of a polyline.

  From the implementation point of view, the selected objects may either be
  removed from the document (current implementation), or kept in the document
  (future implementation), while displaying them on top of the other objects
  (if necessary).

  <paragraph*|Definitions>

  <\description>
    <item*|Tree>As in the main tree API. There are three main types of trees
    with graphical markup: graphics, shapes and groups.

    <item*|Enhanced tree>Trees with graphical markup can be enhanced to
    provide additional properties for the markup by means of with tags. For
    instance, an "enhanced shape" (see below) might be a polyline together
    with a particular color and line width.

    <item*|Radical and properties>In the case of an enhanced tree of the form
    <scm|(with <scm-args|props> <scm-arg|object>)>, <scm-arg|object> is
    called the radical of the enhanced tree and <scm-args|props> the
    properties of the enhanced tree. Notice that an enhanced tree is allowed
    to be reduced to its radical, in which case it has no properties.

    <item*|Graphics>This term corresponds to the main graphics, which is an
    ordered list of enhanced shapes or groups. Enhancements for the main
    graphics can be divided in two categories:

    <\itemize>
      <item>Global properties for the graphics itself, e.g. rendering
      properties, or a background grid.

      <item>Editing properties, which control the current editing behaviour
      of the graphics (polyline mode, current pen colour, etc.).
    </itemize>

    <item*|Shape>A shape is an atomic graphical markup primitive, such as a
    polyline. Typical enhancements for shapes are pen color, fill color, line
    width, arrow mode, etc.

    <item*|Group>A group is an ordered list of enhanced shapes or groups. The
    possible enhancements for groups are the same as the ones for shapes
    (and, in this respect, groups therefore differ from graphics).

    <item*|Sketch> The current sketch corresponds to a single or ordered list
    of enhanced shapes or groups on which the graphical editor is currently
    operating. There are two main modes for the sketch:

    <\description>
      <item*|SELECTING>the sketch corresponds to a selection of enhanced
      shapes or groups in the main document.

      <item*|MODIFYING>the sketch corresponds to a single or ordered list of
      enhanced shapes or groups which are being constructed or modified. The
      trees in the sketch can be new trees or trees which correspond to
      marked (invisible) trees in the main document.
    </description>

    The current sketch is usually displayed on top of all other graphics,
    together with several control points.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|Manipulation of enhanced trees>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(enhanced-tree-\<gtr\>radical <scm-arg|t>)><explain-synopsis|get
    radical>
  <|explain>
    \ Given an enhanced tree <scm-arg|t>, return its radical.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(radical-\<gtr\>enhanced-tree <scm-arg|t>)><explain-synopsis|get
    enhanced tree>
  <|explain>
    Given a radical <scm-arg|t>, find its parent which corresponds to its
    largest enhancement. If <scm-arg|t> does not belong to a TeXmacs
    document, this routine returns <scm|#f>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(enhanced-tree-set! <scm-arg|t> <scm-args|p> <scm-arg|u>)>

    <scm|(enhanced-tree-ref <scm-arg|t> <scm-args|p>)>

    <scm|(enhanced-tree-arity <scm-arg|t>
    <scm-args|p>)><explain-synopsis|analogue of basic tree API>
  <|explain>
    These routines are similar to tree-set, <scm|tree-set!>, etc. except that
    they operate on the radical of the enhanced tree.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(enhanced-tree-properties-set! <scm-arg|t>
    <scm-arg|l>)><explain-synopsis|set properties>
  <|explain>
    Given an enhanced tree <scm-arg|t>, overide its properties with the
    elements in the association list <scm-arg|l>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(enhanced-tree-properties-ref <scm-arg|t>)><explain-synopsis|get
    properties>
  <|explain>
    Obtain an association list with all properties of the enhanced tree
    <scm-arg|t>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(enhanced-tree-property-set! <scm-arg|t> <scm-arg|var>
    <scm-arg|val>)><explain-synopsis|set enhanced property>
  <|explain>
    Set the property <scm-arg|var> of an enhanced tree <scm-arg|t> to
    <scm-arg|val>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(enhanced-tree-property-ref t var)><explain-synopsis|get enhanced
    property>
  <|explain>
    Obtain the property <scm-arg|var> of an enhanced tree <scm-arg|t>.
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Sketch manipulation>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-tree)><explain-synopsis|get current sketch>
  <|explain>
    Return the current sketch tree.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-new <scm-arg|t>)><explain-synopsis|start sketch>
  <|explain>
    Put a new tree in the sketch, which is not part of the document. This
    routine is typically called when starting the construction of a new
    enhanced shape.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-set <scm-arg|t>)><explain-synopsis|set sketch tree>
  <|explain>
    Assign the sketch which a tree <scm-arg|t> which is part of the document
    (and maintain the correspondance between <scm-arg|t> and the sketch).
    This routine is typically called when editing an enhanced shape.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-reset)><explain-synopsis|reset sketch tree>
  <|explain>
    Assign the sketch with an empty group of objects. This routine is
    typically called before starting the selection of a group of objects.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-toggle <scm-arg|t>)><explain-synopsis|toggle a tree in the
    sketch>
  <|explain>
    When the sketch is an enhanced group, this routine toggles whether a tree
    t in the document belongs to the group (and we maintain the
    correspondance between t and the corresponding subtree in the sketch).
    This routine is typically called when selecting a group of objects.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-checkout)><explain-synopsis|checkout the sketch>
  <|explain>
    Enter MODIFYING mode and potentially disable the counterparts of the
    trees in the sketch in the main document.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-commit)><explain-synopsis|commit the sketch>
  <|explain>
    Commit changes made to the sketch in MODIFYING mode and return to
    SELECTING mode.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-cancel)><explain-synopsis|cancel the sketch>
  <|explain>
    Cancel any changes made to the sketch in MODIFYING mode and return to the
    state of the document before the call of sketch-checkout.
  </explain>

  <paragraph*|Misscelaneous>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(sketch-controls-set <scm-arg|l>)><explain-synopsis|set controls>
  <|explain>
    Assign a list of markup objects with control ornaments to the current
    sketch. The ornaments are rendered on top of the sketch as a visial aid
    for the user. Typically, when editing a polyline, <scm-arg|l> consists of
    a list of control points.

  exercises and figures:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-theorem|env-name|display-name>>

    (like ``experiment'') and <src-arg|display-name> the corresponding text
    (like ``Experiment''). When defining a new theorem-like environment like
    <markup|experiment>, an unnumbered variant <markup|experiment*> is

    Similar as <markup|new-theorem>, but for exercises.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-figure|env-name|display-name>>
    Similar as <markup|new-theorem>, but for figures. When defining a new
    type of figure, like ``picture'', the <markup|new-figure> macro defines
    both the inline environment <markup|small-picture> and the
    block-environment <markup|big-picture>, as well as the unnumbered
    variants <markup|small-picture*> and <markup|big-picture*>.
  </explain>

  The theorem-like and remark-like environments belong to a common
  counter-group <verbatim|theorem-env>. By default, we use American-style
  numbering (one common counter for all environments). When selecting the
  package <tmpackage|number-europe>, each environment uses its own counter.
  All exercises and figures use their own counter-group.

  More generally, the <verbatim|std-env> counter-group regroups the counters
  for all standard <TeXmacs> environments. Typically, all counters in this
  group are prefixed in a similar way (for instance by the number of the
  chapter). Figure <reference|std-env-fig> shows how the hierarchical
  organization of this counter group.

  <\big-figure|<tree|<verbatim|std-env>|<tree|<verbatim|theorem-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|theorem>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|proposition>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|remark>>>|<row|<cell|<math|\<vdots\>>>>>>>>|<tree|<verbatim|exercise-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|exercise>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|problem>>>>>>>|<tree|<verbatim|figure-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|figure>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|table>>>>>>>|<verbatim|equation>|<verbatim|footnote>>>
    <label|std-env-fig>Organization of the counters for the standard
    <TeXmacs> environments.
  </big-figure>

  In addition to the standard theorem-like, remark-like, exercise-like and
  figure-like environments, other numbered textual environments may be
  defined using the <markup|new-env> macro. These environments may be based
  on arbitrary counter-groups:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-env|env-name|display-name|group|render>>
    The first argument <src-arg|env-name> specifies the name for the
    environment (like ``experiment'') and the second, <src-arg|display-name>,
    the corresponding text (like ``Experiment''). The third argument is the
    name of the counter <src-arg|group> to which the new environment belongs.
    The last argument <src-arg|render> is the name of a binary macro for
    rendering the environment. The arguments of the rendering macro are a
    name (like ``Theorem 3.14'') and its body. You may use this macro to
    define new environments based on counter-groups other than the standard
    five <verbatim|theorem-env>, <verbatim|exercise-env>, etc. For instance,
    in the standard style-sheets, <markup|new-theorem> is defined by

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\inactive*>
        <assign|new-theorem|<macro|env|name|<new-env|<arg|env>|<arg|name>|theorem-env|render-theorem>>>
      </inactive*>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  We recall that you may add new counters or counter-groups to the
  <verbatim|theorem-env> counter-group using the <markup|new-counter-group>
  and <markup|add-to-counter-group> macros, as described in the section about
  counters.

  The <tmdtd|env-math> <abbr|d.t.d.> specifies which mathematical
  environments can be used inside text-mode. In other words, the environments
  should be used inside text-mode, but their bodies contain mathematical
  formulas or tables of mathematical formulas.

  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|equation-lab|body|lab>>
    An equation with an arbitrary text label to be displayed in references
    (e.g. <markup|reference> or <markup|eqref)>. Notice that the
    <markup|label> tag is not created automatically.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|eqnarray|table>>
    An array of numbered equations (not yet implemented).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|eqnarray*|table>>
    An array of unnumbered equations. You can use the <markup|eq-number> tag
    in order to number the equation.\ 
  </explain>

  <\warning>
    The numbering of equations inside tables is not yet as it should be. In
    particular, the <markup|eqnarray> tag is equivalent to <markup|eqnarray*>
    at the moment. Later on, when the <markup|eqnarray> tag will be
    implemented correctly, you will also have a <markup|no-number> tag in
    order to suppress the number of an equation, and a style package for
    numbering equations at the left hand side.
  </warning>

  <\warning>
    There is no option for numbering equations at the left hand side
    available yet. Nevertheless, you may use the manual tag
    <markup|leq-number> for this. You also have a tag <markup|next-number>
    which directly display the next number and increases the equation
    counter.
  </warning>

  <\warning>
    We do not encourage the use of the AMS-<TeX> environments
    <verbatim|align>, <verbatim|gather> and <verbatim|split>. Nevertheless,
    they are available under the names <markup|align>, <markup|gather>,
    <markup|eqsplit> together with their variants <markup|align*>,
    <markup|gather*> and <markup|eqsplit*>. In the future, we plan to provide
    more powerful environments.

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Background evaluations>

  Until now, we have always considered interfaces between <TeXmacs> and
  applications which are intended to be used interactively in shell sessions.
  But there also exists a <scheme> command

  <\scm-code>
    (plugin-eval <em|plugin> <em|session> <em|expression>)
  </scm-code>

  for evaluating an expression using the application. Here
  <verbatim|<em|plugin>> is the name of the plug-in, <verbatim|<em|session>>
  the name of the session and <verbatim|<em|expression>> a <scheme>
  expression which represents a <TeXmacs> tree.

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|substitute> plug-in>

  Background evaluations may for instance be used in order to provide a
  feature which allows the user to select an expression and replace it by its
  evaluation. For instance, the <verbatim|substitute> plug-in converts
  mathematical <LaTeX> expressions into <TeXmacs>, and it provides the
  <shortcut|(substitute-substitute)> keyboard shortcut for replacing a
  selected text by its conversion. The plug-in consists of the following
  files

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|substitute/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|substitute/progs/init-substitute.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|substitute/src/substitute.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  The main evaluation loop of <verbatim|substitute.cpp> simply consists of

  <\cpp-code>
    char buffer[100];

    cin.getline (buffer, 100, '\\n');

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN;

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "latex:$" \<less\>\<less\> buffer \<less\>\<less\>
    "$";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  Moreover, the configuration file <verbatim|init-substitute.scm> contains
  the following code for replacing a selected region by its evaluation

  <\scm-code>
    (define (substitute-substitute)

    \ \ (import-from (texmacs plugin plugin-cmd))

    \ \ (if (selection-active-any?)

    \ \ \ \ \ \ (let* ((t (tree-\<gtr\>stree (the-selection)))

    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (u (plugin-eval "substitute" "default" t)))

    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (clipboard-cut "primary")

    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (insert (stree-\<gtr\>tree u)))))
  </scm-code>

  as well as the keyboard shortcut for <shortcut|(substitute-substitute)>:

  <\scm-code>
    (kbd-map

    \ \ ("C-F12" (substitute-substitute)))
  </scm-code>

  Notice that these routines should really be defined in a separate module
  for larger plug-ins.

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|secure> plug-in>

  Another example of using an interface in the background is the
  <verbatim|secure> plug-in which consists of the files

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|secure/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|secure/packages/secure.ts>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|secure/progs/init-secure.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|secure/progs/secure-secure.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|secure/src/secure.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  Just as <verbatim|substitute.cpp> above, the main program
  <verbatim|secure.cpp> just converts mathematical <LaTeX> expressions to
  <TeXmacs>. The <verbatim|secure-secure.scm> module contains the <em|secure>
  <scheme> routine <verbatim|latexer>:

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-define (latexer s)

    \ \ (:type (tree -\<gtr\> object))

    \ \ (:synopsis "convert LaTeX string to TeXmacs tree using plugin")

    \ \ (:secure #t)

    \ \ (plugin-eval "secure" "default" (tree-\<gtr\>string s)))
  </scm-code>

  It is important to define <verbatim|latexer> as being secure, so that it
  can be used in order to define additional markup using the <markup|extern>
  primitive. This is done in the style file <verbatim|secure.ts>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      See a LaTeX math command as a TeXmacs expression via plug-in

      <assign|latexer|<macro|x|<extern|latexer|<arg|x>>>>
    </inactive*>
  </tm-fragment>

  After compilation, installation, relaunching <TeXmacs> and selecting
  <menu|Document|Use package|secure>, you will now be able to use
  <markup|latexer> as a new primitive. The primitive takes a mathematical
  <LaTeX> expression as its argument and displays its <TeXmacs> conversion.

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Flow control>

  Besides sequences of instructions, which can be achieved using the
  <markup|concat> primitive, and the mechanism of macro expansion, the
  <TeXmacs> style-sheet language provides a few other primitive for affecting
  the control flow: <markup|if>, <markup|case>, <markup|while> and
  <markup|for-each>. These primitives are available from the
  <menu|Source|Flow control> menu. However, we have to warn the user that the
  conditional constructs are quite fragile: they only apply to inline content
  and the accessibility of macro arguments should not to much depend on the
  conditions.

  The most important primitive <markup|if>, which can be entered using
  <shortcut|(make 'if)>, allows for basic conditional typesetting:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|appendix|<\macro|title|body>
      <style-with|src-compact|none|<compound|<if|<long-document>|<value|chapter-appendix>|<value|section-appendix>>|<arg|title>|<arg|body>>>
    </macro>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  In this example, <markup|appendix> is a block environment consisting of a
  title and a body, and which is rendered as a chapter for long documents and
  as a section for short ones. Notice that the following implementation would
  have been incorrect, since the <markup|if> primitive currently only works
  for inline content:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|appendix|<\macro|title|body>
      <style-with|src-compact|none|<if|<long-document>|<chapter-appendix|<arg|title>|<arg|body>>|<section-appendix|<arg|title>|<arg|body>>>>
    </macro>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <markup|if> primitive may also be used in order to implement optional
  arguments:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hey|<macro|first|second|<style-with|src-compact|none|<if|<equal|<arg|second>|<uninit>>|Hey
    <arg|first>, you look lonely today...|Hey <arg|first> and <arg|second>,
    you form a nice couple!>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  However, <TeXmacs> is not clever enough to detect which arguments are
  optional and which arguments are accessible (<abbr|i.e.> which arguments
  can be edited by the user). Therefore, you will have to manually give this
  information using the <markup|drd-props> primitive. The <markup|case>,
  <markup|while> and <markup|for-each> primitives are explained in more
  detail in the <hyper-link|corresponding
  section|../../format/primitives/prim-control.en.tm> on the
  <hyper-link|<TeXmacs> primitives|../../format/primitives/primitives.en.tm>.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Spell checking>

  If the program <verbatim|ispell> has been installed on your system, then
  you may use it to check your text for misspelled words by pressing
  <shortcut|(spell-start)> or <submenu|Edit|spell>. Notice that you might have to
  verify that the dictionaries corresponding to the languages in which your
  texts have been written have been installed on your system; this is usually
  the case for English.

  When you launch the spell checker (either on the whole text or a selected
  region), you will be prompted at each misspelled word and the footer
  displays the available options:

  <\description>
    <expand|item*|a)>Accepts the misspelled word and all its future
    occurrences in the text.

    <expand|item*|r)>Replace the misspelled word by a correction you have to
    enter.

    <expand|item*|i)>Indicate that the ``misspelled'' word is actually
    correct and that it has to be inserted in your personal dictionary.

    <expand|item*|1-9)>Several suggested corrections for your misspelled
    word.
  </description>

  Notice that <verbatim|ispell> just checks for misspelled words. No
  grammatical faults will be detected.

  When starting the spell checker, it will use the dictionary of the language
  which is active at the current cursor position (or the start of a
  selection). Only text in that language will be checked for. If your
  document contains text in several languages, then you will have to launch
  the spell checker once for each language being used.

  <tmdoc-title|Assignments>

  All user defined <TeXmacs> macros and style variables are stored in the
  ``current typesetting environment''. This environment associates a tree
  value to each string variable. Variables whose values are macros correspond
  to new primitives. The others are ordinary environment variables. The
  primitives for operating on the environment are available from
  <menu|Source|Define>.

  You may permanently change the value of an environment variable using the
  <markup|assign> primitive, as in the example

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hi|<macro|Hi there!>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  You may also locally change the values of one or several environment
  variables using the <markup|with> primitive:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<with|font-series|bold|color|red|Bold red text>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The value of an environment variable may be retrieved using the
  <markup|value> primitive. This may for instance be used in order to
  increase a counter:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|my-counter|<plus|<value|my-counter>|1>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  Finally, you may associate logical properties to environment variables
  using the <markup|drd-props> primitive. This is explained in more detail in
  the section about <hyper-link|macro primitives|../../format/primitives/prim-macro.en.tm>.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Compiling a glossary>

  Glossaries are compiled in a similar way as indexes, but the entries are
  not sorted. A ``regular'' glossary entry just contains some text and a page
  number will be generated for it. An ``explained'' glossary entry contains a
  second argument, which explains the notation. A ``duplicate'' entry may be
  used to create a page number for the second occurence of an entry. A
  glossary line creates an entry without a page number.

  <tmdoc-title|Compatibility with other formats>

  <TeXmacs> documents can be saved without loss of information in three
  formats: the native <TeXmacs> format, <name|Xml> and as a <name|Scheme>
  expression. <TeXmacs> documents can be converted in a <em|wysiwyg>
  (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) way to either <name|Postscript> or
  <name|Pdf>, which are used as the primary formats for <hlink|printing
  documents|../start/man-print.en.tm>. <TeXmacs> finally provides converters
  for <LaTeX>, <name|Html> and <name|MathML>.

  <TeXmacs> documents can be converted to other formats using the different
  items in the <menu|File|Export> menu. Similarly, the <menu|File|Import>
  menu contains all formats which can be imported into <TeXmacs>. Besides
  exporting or importing entire documents, it is also possible to copy and
  paste document fragments using <menu|Edit|Copy to> and <menu|Edit|Paste
  from>. The default formats for copy and pasting can be specified in
  <menu|Tools|Miscellaneous|Export selections as> and
  <menu|Tools|Miscellaneous|Import selections as>.

  <tmdoc-title|Hybrid commands and <LaTeX> simulation>

  <TeXmacs> allows you to enter <LaTeX> commands directly from the keyboard
  as follows. You first hit the <key|\\>-key in order to enter the hybrid
  <LaTeX>/<TeXmacs> command mode. Next you type the command you wish to
  execute. As soon as you finished typing your command, the left footer
  displays something like

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ \<less\>return\<gtr\>: action to be undertaken
  </verbatim>

  When you hit the <shortcut|(kbd-return)>-key at this stage, your command will be
  executed. For instance, in math-mode, you may create a fraction by typing
  <key|\\ f r a c return>.

  If the command you have typed is not a (recognized) <LaTeX> command, then
  we first look whether the command is an existing <TeXmacs> macro, function
  or environment (provided by the style file). If so, the corresponding macro
  expansion, function application or environment application is created (with
  the right number of arguments). Otherwise, it is assumed that your command
  corresponds to an environment variable and we ask for its value. The
  <key|\\>-key is always equivalent to one of the commands <key|inactive l>,
  <key|inactive e>, <key|inactive a>, <key|inactive #> or <key|inactive v>.

  To insert a literal <kbd|\\> (backslash) character, you can use the
  <key|symbol \\> sequence.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Specifying the cell and table size>

  Using <subsubmenu|Table|cell width|set width> resp. <subsubmenu|Table|cell
  height|set height> you may specify the width or height of a cell. In fact,
  the specified width (or height) may be taken into account in three
  different ways:

  <\description>
    <expand|item*|Minimum mode.>The actual width of the cell will be the
    minimum of the specified width and the width of the box inside the cell.

    <expand|item*|Exact mode.>The width of the cell will be precisely the
    specified one.

    <expand|item*|Maximum mode.>The actual width of the cell will be the
    maximum of the specified width and the width of the box inside the cell.
  </description>

  The border width and the cell padding (to be explained below) are taken
  into account in the size of the box inside the cell.

  You may also specify the width and the height of the entire table in
  <submenu|Table|special table properties>. In particular, you may specify
  the table to run over the entire width of a paragraph. When specifying a
  width (or height) for the entire table, you may specify how the unused
  space is distributed over the cells using <subsubmenu|Table|special cell
  properties|distribute unused space>. By default, the unused space is
  equally distributed.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Internationalization>

  The support of a maximal number of foreign languages is another major
  challenge in which your help would be appreciated. Making the translations
  to support a new language usually requires several days of work. We
  therefore recommend you to find some friends or collegues who are willing
  to help you.

  The procedure for adding a new language is as follows

  <\itemize>
    <item>You copy the file <verbatim|english-new.scm> to
    <verbatim|english-<em|yourlanguage>.dic> in <verbatim|langs/natural/dic>
    and fill out the corresponding translations. You may want to use Andrey
    Grozin's dictionary tool at

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ http://www.texmacs.org/Data/dictool.py.gz
    </verbatim>

    In order to use it, may sure that Python is installed on your system,
    download the file, gunzip it, make it executable and run it.

    <item>You tell me about any special typographical rules in your language
    and handy keystrokes for producing special characters.

    <item>I take care of the hyphenation and typographical issues, but you
    test them.

    <item>If you have enough time, you may also consider the translation of
    (part of) the existing documentation.
  </itemize>

  Of course, the support for languages get out of date each time that new
  features are added to <TeXmacs>. For this reason, we also maintain a file
  <verbatim|miss-english-<em|yourlanguage>.dic> with all missing translation
  for your language, once that it has been added. Please do not hesitate to
  send inclomplete versions of <verbatim|english-<em|yourlanguage>.dic> or
  <verbatim|miss-english-<em|yourlanguage>.dic>; someone else may be willing
  to complete them.

  <menu|File|Import|Latex>. Don't forget to save the file under a new name
  with the <verbatim|.tm> extension, if you want to edit it.

  As explained in the introduction, the conversion of <LaTeX> documents into
  <TeXmacs> is more problematic than conversions the other way around. As
  long as you restrict yourself to using the most common <LaTeX> commands,
  the conversion process should not give rise to any major difficulties.
  However, as soon as your documents contain ``weird <TeX> primitives''
  (think about <verbatim|\\csname>...), then the converter may get confused.
  We also notice that <TeXmacs> is currently unable to convert <LaTeX> style
  files and no plans exist to enhance the converter in this direction.

  There are two major reasons for <LaTeX> documents to get imported in an
  inappropriate way, and which can easily be corrected by the user. First of
  all, the parser may get confused because of some exotic syntactic
  construct. This typically happens in presence of catcodes or uncommon
  styles of macro definitions. Sometimes, the parser may also be mistaken
  about the current mode, in which case text gets parsed as a mathematical
  formula or <em|vice cersa>. In both cases, the imported document usually
  becomes ``weird'' at a certain point. In order to solve the problem, we
  suggest you to identify the corresponding point in the <LaTeX> source file
  and to make an appropriate change which avoids the parser of getting
  confused.

  A second common error is that certain <LaTeX> macros are not recognized by
  the converter, in which case they will appear in red. This typically
  happens if you use one of the hundreds additional <LaTeX> packages or if
  you defined some additional macros in another document. In the case when
  the troublesome macro occurs only a few times, then we suggest you to
  manually expand the macro in the <LaTeX> source file before importation.
  Otherwise, you may try to put the definitions of the missing macros in the
  preamble of the <LaTeX> document. Alternatively, you may create a small
  style package with <TeXmacs> counterparts for the macros which were not
  recognized.

  The behaviour of the converter may be customized using several user
  preferences in the <menu|Edit|Preferences|Converters|LaTeX|LaTeX--\<gtr\>TeXmacs>
  menu:

  <\description-long>
    <item*|Import sophisticated objects as pictures>This option allows
    <TeXmacs> to compile the <LaTeX> document in a temporary directory, with
    the package <verbatim|preview> installed, in order to import some macros
    or environments as pictures. The source of each picture is also imported
    in order to be re-exported if needed. Currently, the following macros are
    imported as pictures when this option is set: <verbatim|\\xymatrix>,
    <verbatim|pspicture>, <verbatim|tikzpicture>.

    <item*|Keep track of the <LaTeX> source code>One should be interested in
    this option in order to use <TeXmacs> to make small or isolated
    modifications into a <LaTeX> file (e.g. for a proofreading). This option
    allows <TeXmacs> to import the <LaTeX> document with added markup in
    order to track the original sources of the document paragraphs. These
    tracked sources are, as far as possible, re-used during a <LaTeX>
    re-export.

    <item*|Ensure transparent tracking>This option, subject to the above,
    verify that the added markup does not change the result of the
    conversion. It has been added for testing purpose and may <em|strongly>
    increase the time of the import process (at least it double it).

  <tmdoc-title|Conversion from <TeXmacs> to <LaTeX>>

  A <TeXmacs> document can be exported to <LaTeX> using
  <menu|File|Export|LaTeX>. \ In the case of certain journal styles like
  <verbatim|svjour> or <verbatim|elsart>, the user should also make sure that
  the appropriate style files can be found by <LaTeX>, when compiling the
  result of the conversion. Please consult your <LaTeX> documentation for how
  to do this; one solution which usually works is to put the style file in
  the same directory as your file.

  Notice that the exportation of a <TeXmacs> document with images may cause
  the creation of additional image files. If your destination file is called
  <verbatim|name.tex>, these files are named <verbatim|name-1.eps>,
  <rigid|<verbatim|name-2.eps>>, <abbr|etc.> and they are stored in the same
  directory. In particular, all pictures drawn with the editor and all images
  which are not already in <name|Postscript> format will be converted to
  encapsulated <name|Postscript> files.

  In order to ensure that the generated <LaTeX> document compiles, style
  files and packages or macros with no <LaTeX> equivalents are either ignored
  or replaced by a reasonable substitute. The precise behaviour of the
  converter may be customized using several user preferences in the
  <menu|Edit|Preferences|Converters|LaTeX|TeXmacs--\<gtr\>LaTeX> menu:

  <\description-long>
    <item*|<menu|Replace unrecognized styles>>This option (which is set by
    default) tells <TeXmacs> to replace style files with no <LaTeX>
    equivalents by the <verbatim|article> style. Furthermore, all additional
    style packages are ignored.

    In case you know how to <hlink|write your own style
    files|../../../devel/style/style.en.tm>, you might wish to create
    <TeXmacs> equivalents of those journal styles which you use often.
    Similarly, you might wish to create a style package with your own macros
    together with its <LaTeX> counterpart. In both cases, you might want to
    disable the style replacement option.

    <item*|<menu|Replace unrecognized macros>>By default, all <TeXmacs>
    macros are expanded until they admit direct <LaTeX> counterparts.
    Primitives with no <LaTeX> counterparts (like graphics or trees) are
    ignored. Moreover, in order to convert certain frequently used macros
    like <verbatim|theorem> or <verbatim|strong>, <TeXmacs> may put
    additional definitions in the preamble.

    In some cases, the user may wish to keep unrecognized macros in their
    unexpanded form. For instance, this may be convenient if you want to
    import the generated document back into <TeXmacs>. Another typical
    situation is when you defined additional macros in a style package. In
    these cases, you may disable to macro replacement option. Of course, any
    missing macro definitions may result in <LaTeX> errors during the
    compilation.

    <item*|<menu|Expand user-defined macros>>When your document or its
    preamble contains macro definitions, then <TeXmacs> will convert these
    macro definitions into <LaTeX> macro definitions and keep all macro
    applications in their unexpanded forms. This allows you to preserve as
    much structure of your document as possible. When enabling the
    <menu|Expand user-defined macros> option, all macro definitions in your
    document will be ignored and all macro applications will be expanded.

    <item*|<menu|Export bibliographies as links>>In order to produce
    stand-alone <LaTeX> files whenever possible, it is assumed that you
    generate<nbsp>your bibliographies from within <TeXmacs>. When exporting
    to <LaTeX>, the generated bibliography will be directly included into
    your <LaTeX> file. In some cases however, the user might wish to
    regenerate the bibliography from the <LaTeX> and the bibliography files,
    using <name|Bib<TeX>>. In this case, you need to enable the <menu|Export
    bibliographies as links> option.

    <item*|<menu|Allow for macro definitions in preamble>>Certain <TeXmacs>
    macros like <markup|strong> have no direct <LaTeX> analogues. For a
    certain number of frequently used macros, <TeXmacs> automatically
    generates macro definitions in the preamble of the <LaTeX> target file.
    This allows you to preserve as much structure as possible of your
    document, which is for instance useful if you import the document back
    into <TeXmacs>.

    However, certain journals instruct authors to refrain from the definition
    of additional macros in the preamble. When disallowing for macro
    definitions in preambles, <TeXmacs> will automatically expand all
    corresponding macro applications.

    <item*|Dump <TeXmacs> document into <LaTeX> code>When this option is set,
    a copy of the <TeXmacs> document is appended to the <LaTeX> export in a
    lossless kind. This allows to re-import the document with as few
    conversion artifacts as possible .

    <item*|Character encoding>This option defines the behavior of the
    converter with respect to character encoding. There are three possible
    choices:

    <\description>
      <item*|Utf-8 with inputenc>This will generate <verbatim|utf-8> document
      with the package <verbatim|inputenc> loaded. If for any reason you
      don't want to rely on <verbatim|inputenc>, you should consider other
      options.

      <item*|Cork with catcodes>Keeps accented characters ``as is''. This can
      be achieved by allowing <TeXmacs> to put additional catcode definitions
      into your preamble. This provides a good trade-off between readability
      (accented characters are kept in an 8 bit charset) and simplicity (you
      don't need the <verbatim|inputenc> package).

      <item*|Ascii>This will generate pure <name|ascii> characters, using
      plain <TeX> sequencies to compose non-<name|ascii> symbols.
    </description>
  </description-long>

  Sometimes, the converter does not produce a satisfactory <LaTeX> file even
  after some tinkering with the above preferences. The most frequent problem
  concerns bad line breaks. Occasionally, certain document fragments are also
  better converted by hand. In order to minimize the need for corrections in
  the generated <LaTeX> file (which would be lost when re-exporting the
  <TeXmacs> source file after some modifications), <TeXmacs> provides a
  mechanism to specify manual conversions to <LaTeX> in the <TeXmacs> source
  file: using <menu|Format|Specific|Texmacs> and
  <menu|Format|Specific|Latex>, you may force certain document fragments to
  appear only in the source file or the <LaTeX> target.

  For instance, assume that the word ``blauwbilgorgel'' is hyphenated
  correctly in the <TeXmacs> source, but not in the <LaTeX> conversion. Then
  you may proceed as follows:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>Select ``blauwbilgorgel''.

    <item>Click on <menu|Format|Specific|Texmacs> to make the text
    ``blauwbilgorgel'' <TeXmacs>-specific.

    <item>Click on <menu|Format|Specific|Latex>.

    <item>Type the latex code <verbatim|blauw\\-bil\\-gor\\-gel> with the
    correct hyphenation.

    <item>Press <shortcut|(kbd-return)> to activate the <LaTeX>-specific
    text.
  </enumerate>

  In a similar fashion, you may insert <LaTeX>-specific line breaks, page
  breaks, vertical space, style parameter modifications, etc. You may also
  force arbitrary content to be exported as an image using
  <menu|Format|Specific|Image>.

  <tmdoc-title|Compiling a bibliography>

  <subsubsection*|Editing files with bibliographic entries>

  <TeXmacs> uses the <BibTeX> model for its bibliographies. Manuals about
  <BibTeX> can easily be found at various places on the web. <BibTeX> files
  can either be entered and edited using <TeXmacs> itself or using an
  external tool. Some external tools offer possibilities to search and
  retrieve bibliographic entries on the web, which can be a reason to prefer
  such tools from time to time. <TeXmacs> implements good converters for
  <BibTeX> files, so several editors can easily be used in conjunction.

  The built-in editor for <BibTeX> files is automatically used for files with
  the <verbatim|.bib> extension. New items can easily be added using
  <menu|Insert|Database entry>. When creating a new entry, required fields
  appear in dark blue, alternative fields in dark green and optional fields
  in light blue. The special field inside the header of your entry is the
  name of your entry, which will be used later for references to this entry.
  When editing a field, you may use <shortcut|(kbd-return)> to confirm it and
  jump to the next one (blank optional fields will automatically be removed
  when doing this). When the cursor is inside a bibliographic entry,
  additional fields may also be added using <menu|Focus|Insert above> and
  <menu|Focus|Insert below>.

  <BibTeX> contains a few unnatural conventions for entering names of authors
  and managing capitalization inside titles. When editing <BibTeX> files
  using <TeXmacs>, these conventions are replaced by the following more user
  friendly conventions:

  <\itemize>
    <item>When entering authors (inside ``Author'' or ``Editor'' fields), use
    the <markup|name> tag for specifying last names (using <menu|Insert|Last
    name> or <shortcut|(make 'name)>) For instance, ``Albert Einstein''
    should be entered as ``Albert <name|Einstein>'' or as ``A.
    <name|Einstein>''. Special particles such as ``von'' can be entered using
    <menu|Insert|Particle>. Title suffices such as ``Jr.'' can be entered
    similarly using <menu|Insert|Title suffix>.

    <item>When entering titles, do not capitalize, except for the first
    character and names or concepts that always must be. For instance, use
    ``Riemannian geometry'' instead of ``Riemannian Geometry'' and
    ``Differential Galois theory'' instead of ``Differential Galois Theory''.
  </itemize>

  <subsubsection*|Inserting citations and compiling bibliographies>

  Assuming that you have created a <verbatim|.bib> file with your
  bibliographic references, the mechanism to automatically compile a
  bibliography is the following:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Use <menu|Insert|Link|Citation> and <menu|Insert|Link|Invisible
    citation> to insert citations, which correspond to entries in your
    <verbatim|.bib> file.

    <item>At the place where your bibliography should be compiled, click on
    <menu|Insert|Automatic|Bibliography>. At the prompt, you should enter a
    <verbatim|bibtex> style (such as <verbatim|plain>, <verbatim|alpha>,
    <verbatim|abbrv>, etc.) and your <verbatim|.bib> file.

    <item>Use <menu|Document|Update|Bibliography> in order to compile your
    bibliography.
  </itemize>

  Notice that additional BiB<TeX> styles should be put in the directory
  <verbatim|~/.TeXmacs/system/bib>.

  <tmdoc-title|Starting a new picture>

  You may start drawing a new picture using <menu|Insert|Image|Draw image>.
  In some cases, you may also want to draw something on top of an existing
  image (or other kinds of content). This can be done by selecting the image
  or content on top of which you want to draw, and then click on
  <menu|Insert|Image|Draw over selection>.

  By default, the inserted image spans over the whole paragraph. You may
  adjust its size using the keyboard shortcuts
  <shortcut|(graphics-decrease-hsize)>, <shortcut|(graphics-increase-hsize)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-decrease-vsize)>, <shortcut|(graphics-increase-vsize)>
  (to adjust the size a bit faster, you may use
  <shortcut|(graphics-decrease-hsize-fast)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-increase-hsize-fast)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-decrease-vsize-fast)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-increase-vsize-fast)>). You may also specify an
  explicit size using <menu|Insert|Geometry|Size>. After completion of your
  drawing, you may automatically crop the size of your picture to its actual
  size (plus some additional padding), using <menu|Insert|Geometry|Crop>.

  For technical pictures, it is often useful to display a grid while you are
  drawing. This can be done using<nbsp><menu|Insert|Grid|Type|Cartesian>. In
  the menu <menu|Insert|Grid> it is also possible to adjust the colors of the
  axes and the grid-lines, as well as the number of subunit grid-lines per
  unit grid-line. By default, grids will also be printed; you need to remove
  them after completing your drawing if you do not want this.

  By default, <TeXmacs> places the origin of the grid at the center of the
  screen and uses a <verbatim|1cm> unit. You may scroll the picture using the
  arrow keys <shortcut|(graphics-move-origin-left)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-move-origin-right)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-move-origin-up)>, <shortcut|(graphics-move-origin-down)>
  (or <shortcut|(graphics-move-origin-left-fast)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-move-origin-right-fast)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-move-origin-up-fast)>,
  <shortcut|(graphics-move-origin-down-fast)> if you want to move fast). You
  may specify a different unit using the <menu|Insert|Geometry|Unit> menu.
  You may also zoom in and out using <shortcut|(graphics-zoom-in)> and
  <shortcut|(graphics-zoom-out)>, or from the <menu|Insert|Geometry|Zoom>
  menu.

  <expand|tmdoc-title|Borders, padding and background color>

  You may specify the border widths and padding spaces of a cell in all
  possible four directions: on the left, on the right, at the bottom and at
  the top (see <submenu|Table|cell border>). You have keyboard shorthands of
  the forms <key|table b><render-key|<with|mode|math|x>> and <key|table p
 ><render-key|<with|mode|math|x>> in order to specify border widths and cell padding.

  The default border width for cells in the block environment is
  <verbatim|1ln>, i.e. the standard line width in the current font (like the
  width of a fraction bar). This width occurs at the right and the bottom of
  each cell (except when the cell is on the first row or column). The default
  horizontal cell padding is <verbatim|1spc>: the width of a white space in
  the current font. The default vertical cell padding is <verbatim|1sep>: the
  standard minimal separation between two close boxes.

  Cells may be given a background color via <submenu|Table|cell background
  color>.

  The entire table may also be given a border and a table padding in
  <subsubmenu|Table|special table properties|border>. In this case, the
  padding occurs outside the border.

  <tmdoc-title|Standard <TeXmacs> packages>

  First of all, <TeXmacs> provides several packages for customizing the
  behaviour of the standard styles:

  <\explain|<tmpackage|number-long-article>>
    This package induces all numbers of environments (theorems, remarks,
    equations, figures, <abbr|etc.>) to be prefixed by the current section
    number. It is usually used in combination with the <tmstyle|article>
    style (for long articles) and the <tmstyle|book> style (for books with
    long chapters).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|number-europe>>
    By default, <TeXmacs> uses ``American style numbering''. This means that
    the same counter is used for numbering similar environments like theorem
    and proposition. In other words, a remark following ``Theorem 3'' will be
    numbered ``Remark 4''. If you want each environment to have its
    individual counter, then you should enable ``European style numbering'',
    by selecting the <tmpackage|number-europe> package.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|number-us>>
    This package may be used in order to switch back to American style
    numbering in the case when a third parties style file enforces European
    style numbering.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|structured-list>>
    This is an experimental package. By default, items in unnumbered lists or
    enumerations take no arguments and items in descriptions one argument.
    When using the <tmpackage|structured-list> package, they take an optional
    additional argument with the body of the item.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|structured-section>>
    This is an experimental package. By default, sectional tags only take a
    title argument. When using the <tmpackage|structured-section> package,
    they take an optional additional argument with the body of the section.
    Moreover, the environment <markup|rsection> for recursive sections is
    provided.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|framed-session>>
    This package may be used in order to obtain an alternative rendering of
    interactive sessions. The rendering is designed to be nice for
    interactive use, although less adequate for printing.
  </explain>

  In addition to these packages, and the many packages for internal use,
  <TeXmacs> also provides a few personal example style packages
  <tmpackage|allouche>, <tmpackage|bpr> and <tmpackage|vdh> and several style
  packages for use in combination with external plug-ins (<tmpackage|axiom>,
  <tmpackage|giac>, <tmpackage|macaulay2>, <abbr|etc.>).

  <tmdoc-title|Floating objects>

  Floating objects are allowed to move on the page independently from the
  main text. Usually they contain figures or tables which are too large to
  nicely fit into the main text. A floating object may be inserted using
  <menu|Insert|Note|Floating object>.

  You may also create a floating object and directly insert a figure or table
  inside it using <menu|Insert|Note|Floating figure> resp.
  <menu|Insert|Note|Floating table>. However, sometimes you might want to
  insert several smaller figures or tables inside one floating object. You
  may do this using <menu|Insert|Image|Small figure> resp.
  <menu|Insert|Table|Small table>.

  After creating a floating object, you may control its position using
  <menu|Focus|Allowed positions> (when inside the float). You may specify
  whether you allow the floating object to appear at the top of the page, at
  the bottom, directly in the text, or on the next page. By default, the
  float may appear everywhere. However, a floating object will never appear
  inside the main text at less than three lines from the bottom or the top of
  a page.

  In fact, SVN is not ideal for our documentation purpose, because it is not
  very dynamic. In the future, we plan to create a dedicated publication
  website, which will allow you to save documents directly to the web. It
  should also allow the automatic conversion of the documentation to other
  formats, the compilation of books, etc.

  <tmdoc-title|Inserting images>

  You can include images in the text using the menu <menu|Insert|Image>.
  Currently, <TeXmacs> recognizes the <verbatim|ps>, <verbatim|eps>,
  <verbatim|tif>, <verbatim|pdf>, <verbatim|pdm>, <verbatim|gif>,
  <verbatim|ppm>, <verbatim|xpm> and <verbatim|fig> file formats. Here,
  <verbatim|gs> (i.e. ghostscript) is used to render postscript images. If
  ghostscript has not yet been installed on your system, you can download
  this package from\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html
  </verbatim>

  Currently, the other file formats are converted into postscript files using
  the scripts <verbatim|tiff2ps>, <verbatim|pdf2ps>, <verbatim|pnmtops>,
  <verbatim|giftopnm>, <verbatim|ppmtogif>, <verbatim|xpmtoppm>. If these
  scripts are not available on your system, please contact your system
  administrator.

  By default, images are displayed at their design sizes and aligned at their
  bottom lines. Alternative widths, heights and alignment offsets may be
  specified in the image chooser dialogue window.\ 

  <\itemize>
    <item>When specifying a new width, but no height at the prompt (or vice
    versa), the image is resized so as to preserve the aspect ration. For
    instance, entering a width of <verbatim|1par> will make the image span
    over the entire paragraph width and adjust the height proportionally.

    You may use <verbatim|w> and <verbatim|h> as special lengths for the
    default width and height of the image. For instance, specifying
    <verbatim|2w> and <verbatim|2h> for the width and the height, the image
    will be displayed at twice its default size.

    <item>When specifying an alternative alignment, you may use the
    <verbatim|w> and <verbatim|h> lengths for the displayed width and height
    (<abbr|i.e.> <verbatim|w> and <verbatim|h> no longer stand for the
    default width and height). For instance, using <verbatim|-0.5h> for the
    <math|y>-offset will vertically align the image at its center.
  </itemize>

  We also included a script to convert <name|Xfig> pictures, with optional
  <LaTeX> formulas in it, into encapsulated postscript. In order to include a
  <LaTeX> formula in an <verbatim|xfig> picture, we recall you should enter
  the formula as text, while selecting a <LaTeX> font and setting the special
  flag in the text flags.

  <tmdoc-title|Versioning tools>

  When writing documents in collaboration with other authors, it frequently
  arises that one wants to go through changes made by the other authors, and
  either accept, discard or further correct them. After enabling the
  versioning tool through <menu|Edit|Preferences|Utilities|Versioning tool>,
  a<nbsp>special menu <menu|Version> appears in the main menu bar, which
  makes this process automatic. Below, we will describe in more detail how
  this tool works.

  In addition, there exist many stand-alone programs for maintaining several
  versions of a same file, such as <hlink|<name|Subversion>|http://subversion.tigris.org/>,
  <hlink|<name|Git>|http://git-scm.com/>,
  <hlink|<name|Darcs>|http://darcs.net/>, <hlink|<name|GNU
  Arch>|http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/>, just to mention a few of
  them. <TeXmacs> currently provides a rudimentary support for
  <name|Subversion>, but interfaces for the other systems could easily be
  added.

  <paragraph*|Comparing two versions>

  Assume that we have two versions <verbatim|old.tm> and <verbatim|new.tm> of
  the same document. In order to see the changes, first load the newer
  version <verbatim|new.tm>, then click on <menu|Version|Compare|With older
  version> and select the older version <verbatim|old.tm>. The buffer will
  still be named <verbatim|new.tm>, and the changes between both versions
  will be indicated by special markup. If there are any changes, then the
  cursor will be positioned at the first difference. In a similar way, you
  may compare the current buffer to a<nbsp>newer version on disk using
  <menu|Version|Compare|With newer version>.

  It is possible to go through all the differences between the old and new
  versions either from the items in the submenu <menu|Version|Move>, or using
  the keyboard shortcuts <shortcut|(version-previous-difference)> and
  <shortcut|(version-next-difference)>. One may also use the more general
  structured navigation shortcuts <shortcut|(traverse-first)>,
  <shortcut|(traverse-last)>, <shortcut|(traverse-previous)> and
  <shortcut|(traverse-next)>.

  <paragraph*|Visualization of the differences>

  Differences between the two versions can be displayed in three ways: by
  showing only the old version, only the new version, or both versions
  simultaneously. In all cases, the old version is displayed in dark red and
  the new version in dark green.

  The visualization style can be specified individually for each individual
  change, via <menu|Version|Show> or the keyboard shortcuts
  <shortcut|(version-show 'version-old)> (old version),
  <shortcut|(version-show 'version-new)> (new version) and
  <shortcut|(version-show 'version-both)> (both versions). One may also cycle
  through the different style using the structured variant key
  <shortcut|(variant-circulate (focus-tree) #t)>. If you selected some text,
  then the above actions will apply to the whole selection. In particular, by
  selecting the entire file, you can visualize the older or the newer
  version, or both versions.

  <paragraph*|Retaining a specific version>

  It often occurs that we want to go through the changes between two versions
  and progressively retain either one or the other version for each
  individual difference. Assuming that the cursor is inside a given
  difference, this can be done from entries in the submenu
  <menu|Version|Retain>. Alternatively, one may use the shortcuts
  <shortcut|(version-retain 0)>, <shortcut|(version-retain 1)> and
  <shortcut|(version-retain 'current)> to retain the old, new and currently
  displayed version, respectively. If both versions are displayed, then
  <shortcut|(version-retain 'current)> retains the new version. After
  retaining one of the versions, we automatically jump to the next
  difference, which can then be processed.

  If you selected some text, then any of the above action will retain the
  appropriate version for each of the differences in the selection. This
  applies in particular to the case when you select the entire document. A
  convenient alternative way to process all differences is to use
  <shortcut|(version-previous-difference)> and
  <shortcut|(version-next-difference)> to go through the differences, use
  <shortcut|(version-show 'version-old)> and <shortcut|(version-show
  'version-new)> to select the preferred version. As soon as all differences
  have been processed, you select the entire document and click on
  <menu|Version|Retain|Current version>.

  <paragraph*|Grain control and reactualizing the differences>

  The entries in the submenu <menu|Version|Grain> allow you to control the
  grain with which differences between versions are computed. By default, we
  use the finest grain <menu|Detailed>. It is also possible to compute
  differences on a paragraph-based level, using <menu|Block>. In that case,
  the entire paragraphs in which a change occurs will be highlighted. The
  roughest grain <menu|Rough> will highlight the entire text, if a change
  occurs somewhere inside.

  The grain is used when comparing two documents using
  <menu|Version|File|Compare>, but it is also possible to change the grain
  for a selected portion of text: simply select the text and choose the new
  grain in the submenu <menu|Version|Grain>. This can in particular be
  applied on the entire buffer. Similarly, if you change the grain inside a
  difference, then the difference will be recomputed using the new grain.

  Notice that you may also ``change'' the grain to the current grain. This
  has the effect of reactualizing the differences of a selected portion or of
  the current difference at the cursor position. This may be useful, if you
  made some changes to one of the versions. For instance, assume that the old
  version contained a theorem and that we changed it into a lemma in the new
  version and also modified part of its inside text. When visualizing the
  changes, the whole theorem will be highlighted, since there is no
  appropriate markup to indicate that we just changed from a<nbsp>theorem to
  a lemma. Nevertheless, if we want to compare the inside texts, we may turn
  the old theorem into a lemma and then reactualize.

  <paragraph*|Using external programs for version control such as
  <name|Subversion>>

  If the file you are editing belongs to a directory which is under version
  control (only <name|Subversion> is currently supported, although other
  systems might follow), then the first part of the <menu|Version> menu will
  contain some clickable entries.

  First of all, if the current buffer is under version control, then you may
  take a look at its history using <menu|Version|History>. The history
  contains a list of hyperlinks to older revisions, together with short
  information about who changed what and when. Older revisions cannot be
  saved, but you may compare them to the current user version (on disk or
  being edited) using <menu|Version|Compare|With current user version>.

  After making some changes to a file under version control, the version
  inside the editor or on disk no longer corresponds to the version in the
  repository. Using<nbsp><menu|Version|Commit>, the current user's version
  can be committed to the repository. When doing so, you will be prompted for
  a small explanatory message about the changes that you have made. A file
  which is not yet under version control can be added to the version control
  system using <menu|Version|Register>. Registering a file does <em|not>
  commit it to the repository; you still have to use <menu|Version|Commit> in
  order to do so.

  If, while you were editing, changes to the file were made in the
  repository, then you may merge the result with your current version using
  <menu|Version|Update>. At the moment, no conflict resolution has been
  implemented yet, although this is planned for the future.

  <tmdoc-title|Editing sessions>

  Inside input fields of sessions, the cursor keys have a special meaning:
  when moving upwards or downwards, you will move to previous or subsequent
  input fields. When moving to the left or to the right, you will never leave
  the input field; you should rather use the mouse for this.

  Some facilities for editing input, output and text fields are available in
  the <menu|Session|Field> menu. Keyboard shortcuts for inserting fields are
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-up)> (insert above) and
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-down)>. Keyboard shortcuts for removing
  matching text/input/output fields are <shortcut|(structured-remove-left)>
  (remove backwards) and <shortcut|(structured-remove-right)> (remove current
  fields).

  It is possible to create ``subsessions'' using <menu|Session|Session|Create
  subsession> or <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)>. In that case, the
  current input-output field becomes the body of an unfolded subsession. Such
  a subsession consists of an explanatory text together with the subsession
  body. Subsessions can be folded and unfolded using
  <shortcut|(dynamic-previous)> <abbr|resp.> <shortcut|(dynamic-next)>.
  Subsessions have a nice rendering on the screen when using the
  <tmpackage|framed-session> package in <menu|Document|Use package|Program>.

  Notice that input/output fields and subsessions are foldable: when clicking
  on the prompt with the mouse, you may fold or unfold the entry to hide or
  show the output. For laptop presentations, this folding and unfolding
  process is done automatically when traversing your presentation. It is also
  possible to fold or unfold all fields in a session using
  <menu|Session|Session|Fold all fields> and <menu|Session|Session|Unfold all
  fields>.

  Other useful editing operations are <menu|Session|Session|Clear all
  fields>, which is useful for creating a demo session which will be executed
  later on, and <menu|Session|Split session>, which can be used for splitting
  a session into parts for inclusion into a paper.

  <\example>
    <label|session-example>A typical <name|Maxima> session is given below. If
    <name|Maxima> is present on your system, then you may put your cursor in
    one of the inputs, perform some edits, and try to reexecute it.

  <tmdoc-title|Standard utilities>

  Besides the basic concepts from the previous sections, which underly the
  scheme API for <TeXmacs>, the <scheme> kernel implements several other
  utilities and language extensions. In this section, we will briefly sketch
  some of them on hand of examples. Further details can be found in the
  chapter about <hlink|<TeXmacs> extensions to <scheme> and
  utilities|../utils/scheme-utils.en.tm>.

  <paragraph*|Regular expressions>

  <TeXmacs> implements the routines <scm|match?> and <scm|select> for
  matching regular expressions and selecting subexpressions along a ``path''.
  These routines both work for the <verbatim|content> type. For instance, in
  order to search all expressions of the form

  <\equation*>
    <frac|<with|color|brown|a>|1+<sqrt|<with|color|brown|b>>>
  </equation*>

  in the current buffer, where <math|<with|color|brown|a>> and
  <math|<with|color|brown|b>> are general expressions, one may use the
  following <scheme> command:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|scheme] >
      (select (buffer-tree) '(:* (:match (frac :%1 (concat "1+" (sqrt
      :%1))))))
    </input>
  </session>

  <paragraph*|Dialogues>

  <TeXmacs> supports several commands for interactive dialogues with the
  user. For instance, when executing the following scheme command, you will
  be prompted for two numbers, whose product will be displayed in the footer:

  <\session|scheme|default>
    <\input|Scheme] >
      (user-ask "First number:"

      \ \ (lambda (a)

      \ \ \ \ (user-ask "Second number:"

      \ \ \ \ \ \ (lambda (b)

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (set-message (number-\<gtr\>string (*
      (string-\<gtr\>number a)

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (string-\<gtr\>number
      b)))

      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "product")))))
    </input>

    <\input|Scheme] >
      \;
    </input>
  </session>

  <paragraph*|User preferences>

  When writing a plug-in, you may wish to define some new user preferences.
  This can be done using the <scm|define-preferences> command, which adds a
  list of user preferences, together with their default values and a
  call-back routine. The call-back routine is called whenever you change the
  corresponding preference. For instance:

  <\scm-code>
    (define-preferences

    \ \ ("Gnu's hair color" "brown" notify-gnu-hair-change)

    \ \ ("Snail's cruising speed" "1mm/sec" notify-Achilles))
  </scm-code>

  Preferences can be set, reset and read using <scm|set-preference>,
  <scm|reset-preference> and <scm|get-preference>.

  <paragraph*|New data formats and converters>

  New data formats and converters can be declared using the
  <scm|define-format> and <scm|converter> instructions. When a format can be
  converted from or into <TeXmacs>, then it will automatically appear into
  the <menu|File|Export> and <menu|File|Import> menus. Similarly, when a
  format can be converted to <name|Postscript>, then it also becomes a valid
  format for images. <TeXmacs> also attempts to combine explictly declared
  converters into new ones.

  Typically, the declaration of a new format and a converter would look like:

  <\scm-code>
    (define-format blablah

    \ \ (:name "Blablah")

    \ \ (:suffix "bla"))

    \;

    (converter blablah-file latex-file

    \ \ (:require (url-exists-in-path? "bla2tex"))

    \ \ (:shell "bla2tex" from "\<gtr\>" to))
  </scm-code>

  <tmdoc-title|The standard <TeXmacs> styles>

  The user may select a major style from the <menu|Document|Style> menu. The
  major style usually reflects the kind of document you want to produce (like
  a letter, an article or a book) or a particular layout policy (like
  publishing an article in a given journal).

  The user may further customize the main style, by selecting one or more
  additional style packages. Some of these packages are available in the menu
  <menu|Document|Style|Add package>. Other style packages mainly customize
  specific tags, and they can be selected from the
  <menu|Focus|Preferences|Style options> menu group, whenever available. For
  instance, inside a theorem, you may use <menu|Focus|Preferences|European
  numbering> to enable European style numbering for theorem-like environments
  (that is, theorems, propositions, lemmas, <abbr|etc.> are all numbered
  using their own individual counters).

  In this chapter, we will survey the standard document styles and packages
  provided by <TeXmacs>. Most style files and packages have an abstract
  interface, the <abbr|d.t.d.> (data domain definition), which specifies
  which macros are exported by the style or package, and how to use them.
  Distinct styles or packages (like <tmpackage|header-article> and
  <tmpackage|header-book>) may share the same abstract interface, but differ
  in the way macros are rendered. For this reason, we will mainly be
  concerned with the description of the standard <abbr|d.t.d.>s, except when
  we focus on the rendering. Users may customize standard styles by defining
  new ones which match the same abstract interface (see the chapter on
  <hlink|writing <TeXmacs> style files|../../devel/style/style.en.tm>).

  <tmdoc-title|Contextual overloading>

  For large software projects, it is important that different modules can be
  developed as independently as possible one from each other. Furthermore,
  fundamental modules often implement default behaviour which is to be
  overwritten in a more specialized module. In order to facilitate these two
  requirements, <TeXmacs> implements a system of <em|contextual overloading>.

  In order to get the main idea behind this system, consider the
  implementation of a given functionality, like hitting the return key.
  Depending on the context, different actions have to be undertaken: by
  default, we start a new paragraph; inside a table, we start a new row; etc.
  A naive implementation would check all possible cases in a routine
  <scm|kbd-enter> and call the corresponding routine. However, this makes it
  impossible to add a new case in a new module without modifying the module
  which defines <scm|kbd-enter>. By contrast, the system of contextual
  overloading allows the user to <em|conditionally> redefine the routine
  <scm|kbd-enter> several times in distinct modules.

  For instance, assume that we want to define a function <scm|hello> which
  inserts ``Hello'' by default, but ``<math|hello<around|(||)>>'' in mode
  math, while positioning the cursor between the brackets. Using contextual
  overloading, this may be done as follows:

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-define (hello) (insert "Hello"))

    (tm-define (hello) (:require (in-math?)) (insert-go-to "hello()" '(6)))
  </scm-code>

  \;

  The order in which routines are overloaded is important. <TeXmacs> first
  tries the latest (re)definition. If this definition does not satisfy the
  requirements (<scm|(in-math?)>, in our case), then it tries the before last
  (re)definition, and so on until an implementation is found which matches
  the requirements. For example, if we invert the two declarations in the
  above example, then the general unconditional definition of <scm|hello>
  will always prevail. If the two declarations are made inside different
  modules, then it is up to the user to ensure that the modules are loaded in
  an appropriate order.

  Inside a redefinition, it is also possible to access the former definition
  using the keyword <scm|former>. In particular, the code

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-define (hello)

    \ \ (if (in-math?) (insert-go-to "hello()" '(6)) (former)))
  </scm-code>

  is equivalent to the second declaration in our example.

  Contextual overloading generalizes more classical overloading on the types
  of the arguments, such as <name|C++> style polymorphism. Although one may
  overload on the types of the arguments, it is also possible to impose more
  general conditions on the arguments. For instance, one may sometimes wish
  to write the following kind of code:

  <\scm-code>
    (tm-define (my-replace what by)

    \ \ <em|default-implementation>)

    \;

    (tm-define (my-replace what by)

    \ \ (:require (== what by))

    \ \ (noop))
  </scm-code>

  Besides <scm|tm-define>, several other added language primitives support
  the contextual overloading mechanism. For instance, <scm|kbd-map> and
  <scm|menu-bind> support overloading on mode. The <scm|tm-define-macro> and
  <scm|tm-property> primitives are analoguous to <scm|tm-define>.

  Besides the <hlink|copyright information|copyright.en.tm> macros and

  before, the <tmstyle|tmdoc> style comes with a certain number of other
  macros and functions, which you should use whenever appropriate.

  Notice that the <tmstyle|tmdoc> style inherits from the <tmstyle|generic>
  style, so you should use macros like <markup|em>, <markup|verbatim>,
  <markup|itemize>, <abbr|etc.> from this style whenever appropriate. In
  particular, when documentating program code, you should use
  <menu|Insert|Program|Inline code> and <menu|Insert|Program|Block of code>
  in order to mark such pieces of code.

  <tmdoc-title|Creating technical pictures>

  Besides the possibility to include pictures which were created using other
  programs, <TeXmacs> includes a rudimentary tool for creating your own
  drawings. Although this tool has less features than several most special
  purpose graphical editors, it does have the advantage that it is fully
  integrated with <TeXmacs>. In particular, it is easy to insert text,
  mathematics and hyperlinks inside your pictures. Moreover, pictures which
  are created in this way often look nicer, because they use the same fonts
  and default line width as the surrounding text.

  <tmdoc-title|Mathematical formulas>

  One of the main purposes of <TeXmacs> is to edit mathematical formulas. If
  the cursor is inside a<nbsp>formula (<abbr|i.e.> inside ``math mode''),
  then the mode sensitive menus and toolbars provide buttons for entering
  common mathematical constructs. Similarly, as will be detailed in this
  section, the bahaviour of the keyboard changes so as to allow for the rapid
  typing of mathematical symbols. For instance, typing <key|- \<gtr\>>
  inserts the arrow <math|\<rightarrow\>>.

  Starting with version 1.0.7.10, <TeXmacs> also incorporates several
  features for the ``semantic'' editing of mathematical formulas, which will
  be described at the end of this section. When used appropriately, this
  allows you to write documents in which all formulas are at least correct
  from a syntactical point of view. A ``syntax corrector'' is included to
  assist you with this task. Documents with more semantics are for instance
  useful when using formulas as inputs for a computer algebra system. Such
  documents are also less likely to contain ``typos''. Other interesting
  features, such as semantic search and replace, should be developed in the
  feature.

  <tmdoc-title|Further customization of the interface>

  Having written a working interface between your system and <TeXmacs>, you
  may want to improve it further. Below we will discuss a few directions for
  possible improvement.

  First of all, you may want to customize the keyboard behavior inside a
  <verbatim|myplugin>-session and add appropriate menus. The procedure for
  doing that is described in the chapter about the <name|Guile/Scheme>
  extension language and you may add such support to the file
  <verbatim|init-myplugin.scm>. We again recommend you to take a look at the
  plugins which are shipped with <TeXmacs> inside the directory
  <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins>.

  Certain output from your system might require special markup. For instance,
  assume that you want to associate an invisible type to each subexpression
  in the output. Then you may create a macro <verbatim|exprtype> with two
  arguments in <verbatim|myplugin.ts> and send <LaTeX> expressions like
  <verbatim|\\exprtype{1}{Integer}> to <TeXmacs> during the output.

  In case you connected your system to <TeXmacs> using pipes, you may
  directly execute <TeXmacs> commands during the output from your system by
  incorporating pieces of code of the form:

  <\indent>
    <\verbatim>
      [DATA_BEGIN]command:scheme-program[DATA_END]
    </verbatim>
  </indent>

  in your output. Inversely, when the cursor is inside a session of your
  system, you may use the <name|Scheme> command: <todo|This is no longer true
  (svn r8750).>

  <\indent>
    <scm|(extern-exec plugin-command)>
  </indent>

  in order to execute a command of your system.

  <tmdoc-title|Dynamic libraries>

  Instead of connecting your system to <TeXmacs> using a pipe, it is also
  possible to connect it as a dynamically linked library. Although
  communication through pipes is usually easier to implement, more robust and
  compatible with gradual output, the second option is faster.

  In order to dynamically link your application to <TeXmacs>, you should
  follow the <TeXmacs> communication protocol, which is specified in the
  following header file:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <simple-link|$TEXMACS_PATH/include/TeXmacs.h>
  </verbatim>

  In this file it is specified that your application should export a data
  structure

  <\cpp-fragment>
    typedef struct package_exports_1 {

    \ \ char* version_protocol; /* "TeXmacs communication protocol 1" */

    \ \ char* version_package;

    \ \ char* (*install) (TeXmacs_exports_1* TeXmacs,

    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ char* options, char** errors);

    \ \ char* (*evaluate) (char* what, char* session, char** errors);

    } package_exports_1;
  </cpp-fragment>

  which contains an installation routine for your application, as well as an
  evaluation routine for further input (for more information, see the header
  file). <TeXmacs> will on its turn export a structure

  <\cpp-fragment>
    typedef struct TeXmacs_exports_1 {

    \ \ char* version_protocol; /* "TeXmacs communication protocol 1" */

    \ \ char* version_TeXmacs;

    } TeXmacs_exports_1;
  </cpp-fragment>

  It is assumed that each application takes care of its own memory
  management. Hence, strings created by <TeXmacs> will be destroyed by
  <TeXmacs> and strings created by the application need to be destroyed by
  the application.

  The string <verbatim|version_protocol> should contain <verbatim|"TeXmacs
  communication protocol 1"> and the string <verbatim|version_package> the
  version of your package. The routine <verbatim|install> will be called once
  by <TeXmacs> in order to initialize your system with options
  <verbatim|options>. It communicates the routines exported by <TeXmacs> to
  your system in the form of a pointer to a structure of type
  <cpp-code|TeXmacs_exports_1>. The routine should return a status message
  like

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ "yourcas-version successfully linked to TeXmacs"
  </verbatim>

  If installation failed, then you should return <verbatim|NULL> and
  <verbatim|*errors> should contain an error message.

  The routine <verbatim|evaluate> is used to evaluate the expression
  <verbatim|what> inside a <TeXmacs>-session with name <verbatim|session>. It
  should return the evaluation of <verbatim|what> or <verbatim|NULL> if an
  error occurred. <verbatim|*errors> either contains one or more warning
  messages or an error message, if the evaluation failed. The formats being
  used obey the same rules as in the case of communication by pipes.

  Finally, the configuration file of your plug-in should contain something as
  follows:

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (plugin-configure <em|myplugin>

    \ \ (:require (url-exists? (url "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    "lib<em|myplugin>.so")))

    \ \ (:link "lib<em|myplugin>.so" "<em|myplugin>_exports" "")

    \ \ <em|further-configuration>)
  </scheme-fragment>

  Here <verbatim|<em|myplugin>_exports> is a pointer to a structure of the
  type <cpp-code|package_exports_1>.

  <\remark>
    It is possible that the communication protocol changes in the future. In
    that case, the data structures <verbatim|TeXmacs_exports_1> and
    <verbatim|package_exports_1> will be replaced by data structures
    <verbatim|TeXmacs_exports_n> and <verbatim|package_exports_n>, where
    <verbatim|n> is the version of the protocol. These structures will always
    have the abstract data structures <verbatim|TeXmacs_exports> and
    <verbatim|package_exports> in common, with information about the versions
    of the protocol, <TeXmacs> and your package.
  </remark>

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|dynlink> plug-in>

  The <verbatim|dynlink> plug-in gives an example of how to write dynamically
  linked libraries. It consists of the following files:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|dynlink/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|dynlink/progs/init-dynlink.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|dynlink/src/dynlink.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  The <verbatim|Makefile> contains

  <\quotation>
    <\framed-fragment>
      <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
        <\with|font-family|tt>
          tmsrc = /home/vdhoeven/texmacs/src/TeXmacs

          CXX = g++

          LD \ = g++

          \;

          lib/libtmdynlink.so: src/dynlink.cpp

          \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $(CXX) -I$(tmsrc)/include -c src/dynlink.cpp -o
          src/dynlink.o

          \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $(LD) -shared -o lib/libtmdynlink.so src/dynlink.o
        </with>
      </with>
    </framed-fragment>
  </quotation>

  so that running it will create a dynamic library
  <verbatim|dynlink/lib/libdynlink.so> from <verbatim|dynlink.cpp>. The
  <verbatim|tmsrc> variable should contain <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH>, so as to
  find the include file <verbatim|TeXmacs.h>. The configuration file
  <verbatim|init-dynlink.scm> simply contains

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (plugin-configure dynlink

    \ \ (:require (url-exists? (url "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "libtmdynlink.so")))

    \ \ (:link "libtmdynlink.so" "dynlink_exports" "")

    \ \ (:session "Dynlink"))
  </scheme-fragment>

  As to the <value|cpp> file <verbatim|dynlink.cpp>, it contains a string

  <\cpp-fragment>
    static char* output= NULL;
  </cpp-fragment>

  with the last output, the initialization routine

  <\cpp-fragment>
    char*

    dynlink_install (TeXmacs_exports_1* TM, char* opts, char** errs) {

    \ \ output= (char*) malloc (50);

    \ \ strcpy (output, "\\2verbatim:Started dynamic link\\5");

    \ \ return output;

    }
  </cpp-fragment>

  the evaluation routine

  <\cpp-fragment>
    char*

    dynlink_eval (char* what, char* session, char** errors) {

    \ \ free (output);

    \ \ output= (char*) malloc (50 + strlen (what));

    \ \ strcpy (output, "\\2verbatim:You typed ");

    \ \ strcat (output, what);

    \ \ strcat (output, "\\5");

    \ \ return output;

    }
  </cpp-fragment>

  and the data structure with the public exports:

  <\cpp-fragment>
    package_exports_1 dynlink_exports= {

    \ \ "TeXmacs communication protocol 1",

    \ \ "Dynlink 1",

    \ \ dynlink_install,

    \ \ dynlink_eval

    };
  </cpp-fragment>

  Notice that the application takes care of the memory allocation and
  deallocation of <cpp-code|output>.

  to be improved (better hyphenation, folding, more dynamic subexpressions,
  etc.). As to the real interface with computer algebra systems, the upcoming
  changes fall into two categories:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Changes to the existing interface.

    <item>Support for communication between computer algebra systems.
  </itemize>

  An example of a change of the first type would be support for the automatic
  completion of commands. The second project is far more ambitious and
  targets a semantically safe way to communicate mathematical data. We plan
  to write a stand-alone program for this, which can be used independently
  from <apply|TeXmacs>.

  <tmdoc-title|Beamer styles>

  In order to start writing a laptop presentation, you should first select
  the <tmstyle|beamer> style using <menu|Document|Style|beamer>. There are
  several main ``themes'' for presentations, such as
  <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer theme|Bluish>, <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer
  theme|Ice>, <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer theme|Metal>,
  <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer theme|Reddish>, <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer
  theme|Ridged paper>, which can be selected from the <menu|Document|Beamer
  theme> menu.

  The presentation style includes the <tmstyle|alt-colors> style package,
  which features the use of colors for mathematical formulas, enunciations,
  etc. Additional customizations of the presentation style are available in
  the <menu|Focus|Preferences> menus for the various tags to which they
  apply. For instance, the rendering of slide titles and theorems can be
  further customized.

  The <tmdtd|env-float> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides the following environments for
  floating objects:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|small-figure|body|caption>>
    This macro produces an inline figure with <src-arg|body> as its main body
    and <src-arg|caption> as a caption. Inline figures may for instance be
    used to typeset several small figures side by side inside a floating
    object.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|big-figure|body|caption>>
    This macro produces a big figure with <src-arg|body> as its main body and
    <src-arg|caption> as a caption. Big figures span over the whole paragraph
    width.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|small-table|body|caption>>
    Similar to <markup|small-figure>, but for tables.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|big-table|body|caption>>
    Similar to <markup|big-figure>, but for tables.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|footnote|body>>
    Produces a footnote.
  </explain>

  The figure-like environments also admit \ unnumbered versions
  <markup|small-figure*>, <markup|big-figure*>, <abbr|etc.>, which are
  obtained using <shortcut|(numbered-toggle (focus-tree))>.

  <tmdoc-title|Data relation descriptions>

  <paragraph*|The rationale behind <abbr|D.R.D.>s>

  One major advantage of <TeXmacs> is that the editor uses general trees as
  its data format. Like for <no-break>XML, this choice has the advantages of
  being simple to understand and making documents easy to manipulate by
  generic tools. However, when using the editor for a particular purpose, the
  data format usually needs to be restricted to a subset of the set of all
  possible trees.

  In XML, one uses Data Type Definitions (<abbr|D.T.D.>s) in order to
  formally specify a subset of the generic XML format. Such a <abbr|D.T.D.>
  specifies when a given document is valid for a particular purpose. For
  instance, one has <abbr|D.T.D.>s for documents on the web (XHTML), for
  mathematics <no-break>(MathML), for two-dimensional graphics (SVG) and so
  on. Moreover, up to a cetain extent, XML provides mechanisms for combining
  such <abbr|D.T.D.>s. Finally, a precise description of a <abbr|D.T.D.>
  usually also provides some kind of reference manual for documents of a
  certain type.

  In <TeXmacs>, we have started to go one step further than <abbr|D.T.D.>s:
  besides being able to decide whether a given document is valid or not, it
  is also very useful to formally describe certain properties of the
  document. For instance, in an interactive editor, the numerator of a
  fraction may typically be edited by the user (we say that it is
  <em|accessible>), whereas the URL of a hyperlink is only editable on
  request. Similarly, certain primitives like <markup|itemize> correspond to
  block content, whereas other primitives like <markup|sqrt> correspond to
  inline content. Finally, certain groups of primitives, like
  <markup|chapter>, <markup|section>, <markup|subsection>, <abbr|etc.> behave
  similarly under certain operations, like conversions.

  A Data Relation Description (<abbr|D.R.D.>) consists of a Data Type
  Definition, together with additional logical properties of tags or document
  fragments. These logical properties are stated using so called <em|Horn
  clauses>, which are also used in logical programming languages such as
  Prolog. Contrary to logical programming languages, it should nevertheless
  be relatively straightforward to determine the properties of tags or
  document fragments, so that certain database techniques can be used for
  efficient implementations. At the moment, we only started to implement this
  technology (and we are still using lots of C++ hacks instead of what has
  been said above), so a more complete formal description of <abbr|D.R.D.>s
  will only be given at a later stage.

  One major advantage of the use of <abbr|D.R.D.>s is that it is not
  necessary to establish rigid hierarchies of object classes like in object
  oriented programming. This is particularly useful in our context, since
  properties like accessability, inline-ness, <abbr|etc.> are quite
  independent one from another. In fact, where <abbr|D.T.D.>s may be good
  enough for the description of passive documents, more fine-grained
  properties are often usefull when manipulating documents in a more
  interactive way.

  <paragraph*|Current <abbr|D.R.D.> properties and applications>

  Currently, the <abbr|D.R.D.> of a document contains the following
  information:

  <\itemize>
    <item>The possible arities of a tag.

    <item>The accessability of a tag and its children.
  </itemize>

  In the near future, the following properties will be added:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Inline-ness of a tag and its children.

    <item>Tabular-ness of a tag and its children.

    <item>Purpose of a tag and its children.
  </itemize>

  The above information is used (among others) for the following
  applications:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Natural default behaviour when creating/deleting tags or children
    (automatic insertion of missing arguments and removal of tags with too
    little children).

    <item>Only traverse accessible nodes during searches, spell-checking,
    <abbr|etc.>

    <item>Automatic insertion of <markup|document> or <markup|table> tags
    when creating block or tabular environments.

    <item>Syntactic highlighting in source mode as a function of the purpose
    of tags and arguments.
  </itemize>

  <paragraph*|Determination of the <abbr|D.R.D.> of a document>

  <TeXmacs> associate a unique <abbr|D.R.D.> to each document. This
  <abbr|D.R.D.> is determined in two stages. First of all, <TeXmacs> tries to
  heuristically determine <abbr|D.R.D.> properties of user-defined tags, or
  tags which are defined in style files. For instance, when the user defines
  a tag like

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|hi|<macro|name|Hello <arg|name>!>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  <TeXmacs> automatically notices that <markup|hi> is a macro with one
  element, so it considers <with|mode|math|1> to be the only possible arity
  of the <markup|hi> tag. Notice that the heuristic determination of the
  <abbr|D.R.D.> is done interactively: when defining a macro inside your
  document, its properties will automatically be put into the <abbr|D.R.D.>
  (assuming that you give <TeXmacs> a small amount of free time of the order
  of a second; this minor delay is used to avoid compromising the reactivity
  of the editor).

  Sometimes the heuristically defined properties are inadequate. For this
  case, <TeXmacs> provides the <markup|drd-props> tag in order to
  <hyper-link|manually override|../stylesheet/prim-macro.en.tm> the default
  properties.

  <tmdoc-title|User preferences>

  Preferences are used to store any information you need to keep across
  different runs of <TeXmacs>, like window position and size, active menu
  bars, etc. Internally they are stored in the users home directory as a
  <scheme> list of items like <scm|("name" value)> which therefore has in
  principle no structure. However, a good practice to avoid conflicts is to
  prefix your options by the name of the plugin or module you are creating,
  like in <scm|"gui:help-window-position">.

  The first step in defining a new preference is adding it with
  <scm|define-preferences> and assigning a call-back function to handle
  changes in the preference. This is important for instance in menus, where a
  click on an item simply sets some preference to some value and it's up to
  the call-back to actually take the necessary actions.

  <\warning*>
    One may not store the boolean values <scm|#t>, <scm|#f> directly into
    preferences. Instead one should use the strings <scm|"on"> and
    <scm|"off">. This is due to the internal storage of default values for
    preferences using <scm|ahash-table>.
  </warning*>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(define-preferences <scm-arg|list>)><explain-synopsis|define new
    preferences with defaults and call-backs>
  <|explain>
    Each element of <scm-arg|list> is of the form <scm|("somename"
    default-value notify-procedure)> where <scm|notify-procedure> is a
    procedure taking two arguments like this:

    <scm|(define (notify-procedure property-name value) (do-things))>

    Remember to use the strings <scm|"on"> and <scm|"off"> instead of
    booleans <scm|#t>, <scm|#f>.

  you may specify the algorithm being used. Professional page breaking is
  best in print, but may slow down the editing when being used interactively
  in paper mode. Sloppy page breaking is fastest and medium is professional
  except for multicolumn material, for which the professional algorithm is
  significantly slower.

  You may also allow the page breaking algorithm to enlarge or reduce the
  length of pages in exceptional cases in the submenu <apply|menu|Limits>.
  The stretchability of vertical space between paragraphs and so may be
  specified in <apply|menu|Flexibility>. The factor <with|mode|math|1> is
  default; a smaller factor enforces a more rigid spacing, but the quality of
  the breaks may decrease.

  <tmdoc-title|Overview of the <value|scheme> extension language>

  One major characteristic of <TeXmacs> is the possibility to extend the
  editor using the <name|Guile>-<value|scheme> <em|extension language>. Such
  extensions can be simple, like a personal boot file containing frequently
  used keyboard shortcuts, or more complex, like a plug-in with special
  editing routines for a particular type of documents. The <value|scheme>
  language can also be used interactively from within the editor or invoked
  by special markup like ``actions''.

  In this chapter, we give an overview of why and how to use <value|scheme>
  from within <TeXmacs>. The first sections provide sufficient information
  for someone who wants to program some basic customization of the keyboard
  and menus. The latter sections give an introduction to the general
  architecture of the <value|scheme> API and some important features and
  particularities of way <value|scheme> is used within <TeXmacs>. The reading
  of the overview is highly recommended to anyone who wants to make
  non-trivial use of <value|scheme> inside <TeXmacs>.

  More complete documentation about the <value|scheme> modules provided by
  <TeXmacs> is available from the <menu|Help|Scheme extensions> menu. We also
  recommend the following on-line manuals about <value|scheme> and its
  <name|Guile> implementation:

  <\itemize-minus>
    <item><hlink|The <value|scheme> programming
    language|http://www.scheme.com/tspl2d/index.html>.

    <item><hlink|Guile reference manual|http://latakia.dyndns.org/~ruhl/guile-doc/guile_toc.html>.
  </itemize-minus>

  For further information about <value|scheme>, we refer to
  <hlink|<verbatim|http://www.schemers.org>|http://www.schemers.org>. As a
  general rule, we also encourage users to take a look at the <TeXmacs>
  source code for concrete examples on how to use <value|scheme> from within
  <TeXmacs>.

  It is quite easy to write interfaces between <TeXmacs> and computer algebra
  systems or other scientific programs with structured output. Please
  consider writing interfaces between <TeXmacs> and your favorite system(s).
  <TeXmacs> has already been interfaced with several other free systems, like
  Giac, Macaulay 2, Maxima, GNU Octave, Pari, Qcl, gTybalt, Yacas. Detailed
  documentation on how to add new interfaces is available in the
  <hyper-link|<menu|Help|Interfacing>|../../../devel/plugin/plugin.en.tm>

  <tmdoc-title|Tables of contents>

  The following macros may be used in the main text for adding entries to the
  table of contents. They are automatically called by most sectional macros,
  but it is sometimes desirable to manually add additional entries.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|toc-main-1|entry>

    <explain-macro|toc-main-2|entry>
  <|explain>
    Create an important <src-arg|entry> in the table of contents. The macro
    <markup|toc-main-1> is intended to be used only for very important
    entries, such as parts of a book; it usually has to be added manually.
    The macro <markup|toc-main-2> is intended to be used for chapter or
    sections. Important entries are usually displayed in a strong font.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|toc-normal-1|entry>

    <explain-macro|toc-normal-2|entry>

    <explain-macro|toc-normal-3|entry>
  <|explain>
    Add a normal <src-arg|entry> to the table of contents, of different
    levels of importance. Usually, <markup|toc-normal-1> corresponds to
    sections, <markup|toc-normal-2> to subsections and <markup|toc-normal-3>
    to subsubsections.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|toc-small-1|entry>

    <explain-macro|toc-small-2|entry>
  <|explain>
    Add an unimportant <src-arg|entry> to the table of contents, like a
    paragraph. Since such entries are not very important, some styles may
    simply ignore the <markup|toc-small-1> and <markup|toc-small-2> tags.
  </explain>

  By redefining the following macros, it is possible to customize the
  rendering of tables of contents:

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|toc-strong-1|content|where>

    <explain-macro|toc-strong-2|content|where>
  <|explain>
    Used for rendering table of contents entries created using
    <markup|toc-main-1> <abbr|resp.> <markup|toc-main-2>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|toc-1|content|where>

    <explain-macro|toc-2|content|where>

    <explain-macro|toc-3|content|where>

    <explain-macro|toc-4|content|where>

    <explain-macro|toc-5|content|where>
  <|explain>
    Used for rendering table of contents entries created using
    <markup|toc-normal-1>, <markup|toc-normal-2>,
    <markup|toc-<no-break>normal-<no-break>3>, <markup|toc-small-1>
    <abbr|resp.> <markup|toc-small-2>.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|toc-dots>>
    The separation between an entry in the table of contents and the
    corresponding page number. By default, we use horizontal dots.

  <tmdoc-title|Traversing the <TeXmacs> documentation>

  As a general rule, you should avoid the use of sectioning commands inside
  the <TeXmacs> documentation and try to write small help pages on well
  identified topics. At a second stage, you should write recursive ``meta
  help files'' which indicate how to traverse the documentation in an
  automatic way. This allows the reuse of a help page for different purposes
  (a printed manual, a web-oriented tutorial, etc.).

  The <tmstyle|tmdoc> style provides three markup macros for indicating how
  to traverse documentation. The <markup|traverse> macro is used to
  encapsulate regions with traversal information. It can be inserted using
  the <subsubmenu|Manual|Traversal|Traverse> entry in the
  <menu|Manual|Traversal> or <icon|tm_traverse.xpm> menu. The <markup|branch>
  and <markup|extra-branch> macros indicate help pages which should be
  considered as a subsection and an appendix respectively, whereas the
  <markup|continue> macro indicates a follow-up page. Each of these macros
  should be used inside a <markup|traverse> environment and each of these
  macros takes two arguments. The first argument describes the link and the
  second argument gives the physical relative address of the linked file.

  Typically, at the end of a meta help file you will find several
  <markup|branch> or <markup|continue> macros, inside one <markup|traverse>
  macro. At the top of the document, you should also specify a title for your
  document using the <markup|tmdoc-title> macro, as <hlink|described
  before|copyright.en.tm>. When generating a printed manual from the
  documentation, a chapter-section-subsection structure will automatically be
  generated from this information and the document titles. Alternatively, one
  might automatically generate additional buttons for navigating inside the
  documentation using a browser.

  <tmdoc-title|High level modification routines>

  The routine <scm|tree-set> and the corresponding macro <scm|tree-set!> can
  be used as a higher level interface to the fundamental routines for
  modifying trees as described in the <hlink|previous
  section|edit-fundamental.en.tm>. However, it is still up to the user to
  verify that the resulting edit tree is still correct.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tree-set <scm-arg|which> <scm-args|accessors> <scm-arg|new-value>)>

    <scm|(tree-set! <scm-arg|which> <scm-args|accessors>
    <scm-arg|new-value>)><explain-synopsis|smart tree assignment>
  <|explain>
    This routine replaces the tree <scm|(tree-ref <scm-arg|which>
    <scm-args|accessors>)> by a new content value <scm-arg|new-value>.
    Besides the fact that the routine <scm|tree-set> supports additional
    accessors for <scm-arg|which> (see the description of <scm|tree-ref>
    below), <scm|tree-set> differs from <scm|tree-assign> in this respect
    that <scm|tree-set> tries to cleverly decompose the assignment into
    fundamental modification routines. The objective of this decomposition is
    to make a less intrusive modifications in the document, so as to preserve
    as many tree positions and cursor positions as possible.

    For instance, the operation <scm|(tree-set t t)> is a no-operation for
    all trees <scm|t>. A more complex operations like

    <\scm-code>
      (<scm|tree-set!> t `(foo "Hop" ,(<scm|tree-ref> t 2)))
    </scm-code>

    is decomposed into the following fundamental modifications:

    <\scm-code>
      (<scm|tree-remove-node!> t 2)

      (<scm|tree-insert-node!> t 1 '(foo "Hop"))
    </scm-code>

    Like in the case <scm|tree-assign> and <scm|tree-assign!>, you should use
    the macro <scm|tree-set!> in order to update the value of <scm-arg|which>
    if <scm-arg|which> is a <scheme> variable <scm-arg|accessors> is the
    empty list.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tree-ref <scm-arg|which> <scm-args|accessors>)><explain-synopsis|enhanced
    tree access>
  <|explain>
    In its simplest form, this routine allows for the quick access of a
    subtree of <scm-arg|which> via a list of integers <scm-arg|accessors>.
    For instance, if <scm-arg|which> contains the tree <scm|(frac "a" (sqrt
    "b")))>, then <scm|(tree-ref <scm-arg|which> 1 0)> returns the tree
    <scm|"b">.

    In its general form, <scm|tree-ref> relies on the routine <scm|select> in
    order to compute the desired subtree. With <scm-arg|which> as in the
    above example, this makes it possible to retrieve the subtree
    <rigid|<scm|(sqrt "b")>> using <scm|(tree-ref t 'frac)>. In the case when
    there are several matches, the first match is returned. For instance, if
    <scm-arg|which> contains the tree <rigid|<scm|(frac (sqrt "a") (sqrt
    "b")))>>, then <scm|(tree-ref t 'frac)> returns <rigid|<scm|(sqrt "a")>>.

    In fact, the result of <scm|tree-ref> is not necessarily a subtree of
    <scm-arg|which>: the <scm|select> utility also accepts the accessors
    <scm|:up>, <scm|:down>, <scm|:next>, <scm|:previous>, <abbr|etc.> for
    navigating inside the edit tree starting with <scm-arg|which>. For
    instance, <scm|(tree-ref (cursor-tree) :up)> returns the parent of the
    cursor tree. For more details, we refer to the documentation of
    <scm|select>.
  </explain>

  Besides the above routine for the direct modification of a subtree of the
  document, <TeXmacs> also provides several routines for inserting content at
  the current cursor position.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(insert <scm-arg|what>)><explain-synopsis|insertion of content>
  <|explain>
    Insert the content <scm-arg|what> at the current cursor position.
    <TeXmacs> does some additional checking whether it is allowed to perform
    the insertion. For instance, it is disallowed to insert multi-paragraph
    content inside a mathematical formula. Whenever the user attempts to make
    an invalid insertion, then <scm|insert> is equivalent to a no-operation.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(make <scm-arg|lab>)><explain-synopsis|insertion of a tag>
  <|explain>
    This routine may be used to insert a valid tag with label <scm-arg|lab>.
    As many empty arguments as necessary are inserted in order to make the
    tag valid. Similarly, if <scm-arg|lab> is a multi-paragraph tag, then the
    necessary operations are performed to put the tag in a separate
    paragraph.
  </explain>

  <scm|make-with>, <scm|insert-return>, etc.

  <tmdoc-title|Example of a plug-in with <scheme> code>

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|world> plug-in>

  Consider the <verbatim|world> plug-in in the directory

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/examples/plugins
  </verbatim>

  This plug-in shows how to extend <TeXmacs> with some additional <scheme>
  code in the file

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|world/progs/init-world.scm>
  </verbatim>

  In order to test the <verbatim|world> plug-in, you should recursively copy
  the directory

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/examples/plugins/world
  </verbatim>

  to <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/plugins> or <verbatim|$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins>.
  When relaunching <TeXmacs>, the plug-in should now be automatically
  recognized (a <menu|World> menu should appear in the menu bar).

  <paragraph*|How it works>

  The file <verbatim|init-world.scm> essentially contains the following code:

  <\scm-code>
    (plugin-configure world

    \ \ (:require #t))

    \;

    (when (supports-world?)

    \ \ (display* "Using world plug-in!\\n"))
  </scm-code>

  The configuration option <scm|:require> specifies a condition which needs
  to be satisfied for the plug-in to be detected by <TeXmacs> (later on, this
  will for instance allow us to check whether certain programs exist on the
  system). The configuration is aborted if the requirement is not fulfilled.

  Assuming that the configuration succeeds, the <verbatim|supports-world?>
  predicate will evaluate to <verbatim|#t>. In our example, the body of the
  <scm|when> statement corresponds to some further initialization code, which
  just sends a message to the standard output that we are using our plug-in.
  In general, this kind of initialization code should be very short and
  rather load a module which takes care of the real initialization. Indeed,
  keeping the <verbatim|init-<em|myplugin>.scm> files simple will reduce the
  startup time of<nbsp><TeXmacs>.

  <tmdoc-title|Structured editing>

  As a general rule, the behaviour of most structured editing operations is
  conditioned by the <em|<rigid|current focus>>. By default, the innermost
  tag which contains the cursor. Whenever some selection is active, the
  current focus is the innermost tag which contains the selection. During
  structured operations, such as navigating among similar tags, the current
  focus may temporarily be set to something else. The current focus is
  visually indicated by the innermost cyan box around the cursor.

  For instance, the <em|structured insertion> commands
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-left)>, <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)>,
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-up)> and <shortcut|(structured-insert-down)>
  have a particular meaning both inside tables and trees. Inside tables, they
  allow you to insert new rows and columns (see
  figure<nbsp><reference|matrix-insert-fig>). Inside trees, they correspond
  to the insertion of new nodes (see figure<nbsp><reference|tree-insert-fig>).
  Whenever you inside a tree inside a table, then the innermost tag is a
  tree, and node insertions will take precedence over the insertion of new
  rows and columns.

  In many cases, a ``default particular behaviour'' has been defined for all
  tags minus some exceptional ones. In our example of structured insertion,
  the default behaviour of <shortcut|(structured-insert-left)> and
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-right)> is to insert a new argument to the tag
  at the left or at the right (when allowed).

  backward <abbr|resp.> forward <em|structured deletion>. In the case of
  matrices, this will result in the removal of the column before or after the

  <tmdoc-title|The boxes produced by the typesetter>

  <section|Introduction>

  The <TeXmacs> typesetter essentially translates a document represented by a
  tree into a graphical box, which can either be displayed on the screen or
  on a printer. Contrary to a system like <LaTeX>, the graphical box actually
  contains much more information than is necessary for a graphical rendering.
  Roughly speaking, this information can be subdivided into the following
  categories:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Logical and physical bounding boxes.

    <item>A method for graphical rendering.

    <item>Miscellaneous typesetting information.

    <item>Keeping track of the source subtree which led to the box.

    <item>Computing the positions of cursors and selections.

    <item>Event handlers for dynamic content.
  </itemize>

  The logical bounding box is used by the typesetter to position the box with
  respect to other boxes. A certain amount of other information, such as the
  slant of the box, is also stored for the typesetter. The physical bounding
  box encloses the graphical representation of the box. This knowledge is
  needed when partially redrawing a box in an efficient way.

  In order to position the cursor or when making a selection, it is necessary
  to have a correspondence between logical positions in the source tree and
  physical positions in the typesetted boxes. More precisely, boxes and their
  subboxes are logically organized as a tree. Boxes provide routines to
  translate between paths in the box tree and the source tree and to find the
  path which is associated to a graphical point.

  <section|The correspondence between a box and its source>

  <subsection|Discussion of the problems being encountered>

  In order to implement the correspondence between paths in the source tree
  and the box tree, one has to face several simultaneous difficulties:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>Due to line breaking, footnotes and macro expansions, the
    correspondence may be non straightforward.

    <item>The correspondence has to be reasonably time and space efficient.

    <item>Some boxes, such header and footers, or certain results of macro
    expansions, may not be ``accessible''. Although one should be able to
    find a reasonable cursor position when clicking on them, the contents of
    this box can not be edited directly.

    <item>The correspondence has to be reasonably complete (see the next
    section).
  </enumerate>

  The first difficulty forces us to store a path in the source tree along
  with any box. In order to save storage, this path is stored in a reversed
  manner, so that common heads can be shared. This common head sharing is
  also necessary to quickly change the source locations when modifying the
  source tree, for instance by inserting a new paragraph.

  In order to cope with the third difficulty, the inverse path may start with
  a negative number, which indicates that the box can not directly be edited
  (we also say that the box is a decoration). In this case, the tail of the
  inverse path corresponds to a location in the source tree, where the cursor
  should be positioned when clicking on the box. The negative number
  influences the way in which this is done.

  <subsection|The three kinds of paths>

  More precisely, we have to deal with three kinds of paths:

  <\description>
    <item*|Tree paths>These paths correspond to paths in the source tree.
    Actually, the path minus its last item points to a subtree of the source
    tree. The last item gives a position in this subtree: if the subtree is a
    leaf, i.e. a string, it is a position in this string. Otherwise a zero
    indicates a position before the subtree and a one a position after the
    subtree.

    <item*|Inverse paths>These are just reverted tree paths (with shared
    tails), with an optional negative head. A negative head indicates that
    the tree path is not accessible, i.e. the corresponding subtree does not
    correspond to editable content. If the negative value is <math|-2>,
    <math|-3> or <math|-4>, then a zero or one has to be put behind the tree
    path, depending on the value and the cursor position.

    <item*|Box paths>These paths correspond to logical paths in the box tree.
    Again, the path minus its last item points to a subbox of the main box,
    and the last item gives a position in this subtree: if the subbox
    corresponds to a text box it is a position in this text. Otherwise a zero
    indicates a position before the subbox and a one a position after it. In
    the case of side boxes, a two and a three may also indicate the position
    after the left script resp. before the right script.
  </description>

  <subsection|The conversion routines>

  In order to implement the conversion between the three kinds of paths,
  every box comes with a reference inverse path <verbatim|ip> in the source
  tree. Composite boxes also come with a left and a right inverse path
  <verbatim|lip> resp. <verbatim|rip>, which correspond to the left-most and
  right-most accessible paths in its subboxes (if there are such subboxes).

  The routine:

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ virtual path box_rep::find_tree_path (path bp)
  </verbatim>

  transforms a box path into a tree path. This routine (which only uses
  <verbatim|ip>) is fast and has a linear time complexity as a function of
  the lengths of the paths. The routine:\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ virtual path box_rep::find_box_path (path p)
  </verbatim>

  does the inverse conversion. Unfortunately, in the worst case, it may be
  necessary to search for the matching tree path in all subboxes.
  Nevertheless, in the best case, a dichotomic algorithm (which uses
  <verbatim|lip> and <verbatim|rip>), finds the right branch how to descend
  in a logarithmic time. This algorithm also has a quadratic time complexity
  as a function of the lengths of the paths, because we frequently need to
  revert paths.

  <section|The cursor and selections>

  In order to fulfill the requirement of being a ``structured editor'',
  <TeXmacs> needs to provide a (reasonably) complete correspondence between
  logical tree paths and physical cursor positions. This yields an additional
  difficulty in the case of ``environment changes'', such as a change in font
  or color. Indeed, when you are on the border of such a change, it is not
  clear <with|font-shape|italic|a priori> which environment you are in.

  In <TeXmacs>, the cursor position therefore contains an <math|x> and a
  <math|y> coordinate, as well as an additional infinitesimal
  <math|x>-coordinate, called <math|\<delta\>>. A change in environment is
  then represented by a box with an infinitesimal width. Although the
  <math|\<delta\>>-position of the cursor is always zero when you select
  using the mouse, it may be non zero when moving around using the cursor
  keys. The linear time routine:\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ virtual path box_rep::find_box_path (SI x, SI y, SI delta)
  </verbatim>

  as a function of the length of the path searches the box path which
  corresponds to a cursor position. Inversely, the routine:\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ virtual cursor box_rep::find_cursor (box bp)
  </verbatim>

  yields a graphical representation for the cursor at a certain box path. The
  cursor is given by its <math|x>, <math|y> and <math|\<delta\>> coordinates
  and a line segment relative to this origin, given by its extremities
  <math|<around|(|x<rsub|1>,y<rsub|1>|)>> and
  <math|<around|(|x<rsub|2>,y<rsub|2>|)>>.

  In a similar way, the routine:\ 

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ virtual selection box_rep::find_selection (box lbp, box rbp)
  </verbatim>

  computes the selection between two given box paths. This selection
  comprises two delimiting tree paths and a graphical representation in the
  form of a list of rectangles.

  <tmdoc-title|Printing documents>

  You can print the current file using <menu|File|Print|Print all>. By
  default, <TeXmacs> assumes that you have a 600dpi printer for a4 paper.
  These default settings can be changed in <menu|Edit|Preferences|Printer>.
  You can also print to a postscript file using <menu|File|Print|Print all to
  file> (in which case the default printer settings are used for creating the
  output) or <menu|File|Export|Postscript> (in which case the printer
  settings are ignored).

  You may export to <acronym|PDF> using <menu|File|Export|Pdf>. Notice that
  you should set <menu|Edit|Preferences|Printer|Font type|Type 1> if you want
  the produced Postscript or <acronym|PDF> file to use <name|Type 1>
  fonts.<index|pdf> However, only the CM fonts admit <name|Type 1> versions.
  These CM fonts are of a slightly inferior quality to the EC fonts, mainly
  for accented characters. Consequently, you might prefer to use the EC fonts
  as long as you do not need a PDF file which looks nice in <name|Acrobat
  Reader>.

  When adequately configuring <TeXmacs>, the editor is guaranteed to be
  <em|wysiwyg>: the result after printing out is exactly what you see on your
  screen. In order to obtain full wysiwygness, you should in particular
  select <menu|Document|Page|Type|Paper> and <menu|Document|Page|Screen
  layout|Margins as on paper>. You should also make sure that the characters
  on your screen use the same number of dots per inch as your printer. This
  rendering precision of the characters may be changed using
  <menu|Document|Font|Dpi>. Currently, minor typesetting changes may occur
  when changing the dpi, which may globally affect the document through line
  and page breaking. In a future release this drawback should be removed.

  <tmdoc-title|The font selection system>

  In <TeXmacs>, the global document font can be specified using
  <menu|Document|Font>. It is also possible to locally use another font using
  <menu|Format|Font>. Both <menu|Document|Font> and <menu|Format|Font> open
  the <TeXmacs> font browser. Fonts have three main characteristics:

  <\description>
    <item*|Family>Fonts are grouped together into <em|families> with a
    similar design.

    <item*|Shape>Inside the same font family, individual fonts have different
    <em|shapes>, such as bold, italic, small capitals, etc.

    <item*|Size>The font <em|size> in points.
  </description>

  The user may directly specify these three characteristics in the font
  browser, which also displays some sample text for the selected font.

  The font browser also provides a way to quickly select fonts based on
  desirable font properties. For instance, by filtering on a ``bold weight''
  and ``sans serif'', one may find a bold sans serif font which mixes as well
  as possible with the main font. <TeXmacs> allows you to filter on the
  following criteria:

  <\description>
    <item*|Weight>The font <em|weight> corresponds to the ``thickness'' of
    the font:

    <center|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-series|thin|Thin>>|<cell|<with|font-series|light|Light>>|<cell|Medium>|<cell|<with|font-series|bold|Bold>>|<cell|<with|font-series|black|Black>>>>>>>

    <item*|Slant>The font <em|slant> determines the angle of the font:

    <center|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-family|normal|Normal>>|<cell|<with|font-shape|italic|Italic>>|<cell|<with|font-shape|slanted|Oblique>>>>>>>

    <item*|Stretch>This property determines the horizontal width for a fixed
    vertical height:

    <center|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-shape|condensed|Condensed>>|<cell|<with|font-shape|unextended|Unextended>>|<cell|<with|font-shape|wide|Wide>>>>>>>

    <item*|Case>This property determines how lowercase letters are
    capitalized:

    <center|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-shape|mixed|Mixed>>|<cell|<with|font-shape|small-caps|Small
    capitals>>>>>>>

    <item*|Serif>This feature corresponds to the projecting features called
    ``serifs'' at the end of strokes:

    <center|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-family|rm|Serif>>|<cell|<with|font-family|ss|Sans
    Serif>>>>>>>

    <item*|Spacing>This feature corresponds to the horizontal spacing between
    characters:

    <center|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-family|rm|Proportional>>|<cell|<with|font-family|tt|Monospaced>>>>>>>

    <item*|Device>This property can be used to immitate specific ``writing
    devices'':

    <center|<block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-family|rm|Print>>|<cell|<with|font-family|tt|Typewriter>>|<cell|<with|font-family|digital|Digital>>|<cell|<with|font-family|pen|Pen>>|<cell|<with|font-family|artpen|Art
    pen>>|<cell|<with|font-family|chalk|Chalk>>|<cell|<with|font-family|marker|Marker>>>>>>>

    <item*|Category>Various other font features:

    <htab|5mm><block|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<with|font-family|ancient|Ancient>>|<cell|<with|font-family|attached|Attached>>|<cell|<with|font-family|calligraphic|Calligraphic>>|<cell|<with|font-family|comic|Comic>>|<cell|<with|font-family|decorative|Decorative>>>|<row|<cell|<with|font-family|distorted|Distorted>>|<cell|<with|font-family|gothic|Gothic>>|<cell|<with|font-family|handwritten|Handwritten>>|<cell|<with|font-family|initials|Initials>>|<cell|<with|font-family|medieval|Medieval>>>|<row|<cell|<with|font-family|miscellaneous|Misscellaneous>>|<cell|<with|font-family|outline|Outline>>|<cell|<with|font-family|retro|Retro>>|<cell|<with|font-family|scifi|Scifi>>|<cell|<with|font-family|title|Title>>>>>><htab|5mm>
  </description>

  Each of the above properties really constitutes a <em|hint> on how the kind
  of font which <em|should> be used. If no suitable font can be found on your
  particular system, then setting these properties may have no effect.
  Whenever you apply one or more filters, the font browser indicates which
  fonts match the selected properties. It also indicates the closest match
  for the current font in use. When pressing the <menu|Ok> button without
  selecting any particular matching font, then the selected font properties
  will be inserted as <TeXmacs> markup and used as rendering hints. In that
  case, the rendering may change when selecting another global document font
  (for instance).

  It should be noticed that <TeXmacs> comes with a limited number of
  preinstalled fonts, such as the <with|font|Stix|Stix> fonts and several
  fonts prefixed by ``TeXmacs''. Documents which only use these fonts will be
  rendered the same on different systems (assuming the same version of
  <TeXmacs>). When your documents contain other fonts as well, then these
  fonts may be replaced by closest matches when opening your document under a
  different operating system.

  <tmdoc-title|General architecture of the <value|scheme> API>

  When programming <value|scheme> extensions of <TeXmacs>, it may be useful
  to be conscious of the internal architecture of the <value|scheme> modules
  inside <TeXmacs> (see figure <reference|scheme-api-fig>).

  extensions, utilities and libraries|<point|0|-1.5>>>>>|<label|scheme-api-fig>Schematic
  organization of the <value|scheme> API.>

  <paragraph*|Built-in <value|scheme> commands>

  On the very basic level, one has the standard <value|scheme> language, with
  some enhancements by the <name|Guile> implementation (these extensions are
  used as least as possible, for future portability). The standard
  <value|scheme> language is enriched by some routines implemented in the C++
  part of <TeXmacs> and exported to <value|scheme> via the glue. If you
  unpacked the source code of <TeXmacs> in <verbatim|<em|source-dir>>, then
  you can find a full list of the routines exported by the glue in the files

  <verbatim| \ \ \ <em|source-dir>/src/Guile/Glue/build-glue-base.scm<new-line>
  \ \ \ <em|source-dir>/src/Guile/Glue/build-glue-editor.scm<new-line>
  \ \ \ <em|source-dir>/src/Guile/Glue/build-glue-server.scm>

  <paragraph*|Extensions to <value|scheme> and further utilities>

  Above the standard <value|scheme> language and the extra routines from the
  glue, <TeXmacs> comes with a second level of language extensions, utilities
  and libraries. The corresponding <value|scheme> files can be found in the
  directories

  <verbatim| \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/kernel<new-line>
  \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/utils>

  Roughly speaking, the functionality provided by this second level is the
  following:

  <\itemize>
    <item>A certain number of frequently used
    <hlink|abbreviations|../utils/utils-abbrevs.en.tm>, like <scm|==> for
    <scm|equal?>.

    <item>General language extensions for <hlink|contextual
    overloading|overview-overloading.en.tm>, <hlink|logical
    programming|overview-meta.en.tm>, <abbr|etc.>

    <item><TeXmacs>-specific language extensions for the definition of
    <hlink|menus|../utils/utils-menus.en.tm>, <hlink|keyboard
    shortcuts|../utils/utils-keyboard.en.tm>, <abbr|etc.>

    <item>Additional routines for <hlink|<TeXmacs> content
    manipulation|overview-content.en.tm> and pattern matching.

    <item>Further utilities and libraries for common types like strings and
    lists.
  </itemize>

  Whereas the modules in <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/kernel> are
  automatically loaded, all modules in <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/utils>
  have to be explicitly included.

  <paragraph*|Internal modules and plug-ins>

  The remaining <value|scheme> extensions of <TeXmacs> are regrouped into
  <em|internal modules> which usually correspond to a particular type of
  content. For instance, the directories

  <verbatim| \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/source<new-line>
  \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/math<new-line> \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/progs/table>

  respectively contain routines for editing source code, mathematics and
  tables. Exceptions are the internal modules <verbatim|content> and
  <verbatim|fonts>, which rather correspond to a particular type of
  functionality. Each internal module corresponds to a group of files, each
  of which corresponds to an individual <em|<TeXmacs> module>. The internal
  modules are designed to be as independent as possible.

  From the <value|scheme> point of view, the structure of a plug-in is very
  similar to that of an internal module. Each plug-in defines a collection of
  <value|scheme> programs in its <verbatim|progs> subdirectory. Although
  distinct plug-ins may in principle depend on each other, they are usually
  designed in a way which makes them as independent as possible.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|left|large-delimiter>

    <explain-macro|left|large-delimiter|size>

    <explain-macro|left|large-delimiter|bottom|top>

    <explain-macro|mid|large-delimiter|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>>

    <explain-macro|right|large-delimiter|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>><explain-synopsis|large
    delimiters>
  <|explain>
    These primitives are used for producing large delimiters, like in the
    formula

    <\equation*>
      <left|langle><frac|1|a<rsub|1>><mid|\|><frac|1|a<rsub|2>><mid|\|>\<cdots\><mid|\|><frac|1|a<rsub|n>><right|rangle>.
    </equation*>

    Matching left and right delimiters are automatically sized so as contain
    the enclosed expression. Between matching left and right delimiters, the
    formula may contain an arbitrary number of middle delimiters, which are
    sized in a similar way. Contrary to <TeX>, the depth of a large delimiter
    is not necessarily equal to its height, so as to correctly render
    formulas like

    <\equation*>
      f<left|(><frac|1|x+<frac|1|y+<frac|1|z>>><right|)>
    </equation*>

    The user may override the automatically determined size by specifying
    additional length parameters <src-arg|size> or <src-arg|bottom> and
    <src-arg|top>. For instance,

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|f<left|(|-8mm|4mm>x<mid|\||8mm>y<right|)|-4mm|8mm>>
    </tm-fragment>

    is rendered as

    <\equation*>
      f<left|(|-8mm|4mm>x<mid|\||8mm>y<right|)|-4mm|8mm>
    </equation*>

    The <src-arg|size> may also be a number <with|mode|math|n>, in which case
    the <with|mode|math|n>-th available size for the delimiter is taken. For
    instance,

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|g<left|(|0><left|(|1><left|(|2><left|(|3>z<right|)|3><right|)|2><right|)|1><right|)|0>>
    </tm-fragment>

    is rendered as

    <\equation*>
      g<left|(|0><left|(|1><left|(|2><left|(|3>z<right|)|3><right|)|2><right|)|1><right|)|0>
    </equation*>
  </explain>

  \;

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|big|big-symbol><explain-synopsis|big symbols>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is used in order to produce big operators as in

    <\equation>
      <label|big-example><big|sum><rsub|i=0><rsup|\<infty\>>a<rsub|i>*z<rsup|i><big|.>
    </equation>

    The size of the operator depends on whether the formula is rendered in
    ``display style'' or not. Formulas in separate equations, like
    (<reference|big-example>), are said to be rendered in display style,
    contrary to formulas which occur in the main text, like
    <with|mode|math|<big|sum><rsub|i=0><rsup|\<infty\>>a<rsub|i>*z<rsup|i><big|.>>.
    The user may use <menu|Format|Display style> to override the current
    settings.

    Notice that the formula (<reference|big-example>) is internally
    represented as

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<big|sum><rsub|i=0><rsup|\<infty\>>a<rsub|i>*z<rsup|i><big|.>>
    </tm-fragment>

    The invisible big operator <inactive*|<big|.>> is used to indicate the
    end of the scope of <inactive*|<big|sum>>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|frac|num|den><explain-synopsis|fractions>
  <|explain>
    The <markup|frac> primitive is used in order to render fractions like
    <with|mode|math|<frac|x|y>>. In display style, the numerator
    <src-arg|num> and denominator <src-arg|den> are rendered in the normal
    size, but display style is turned of when typesetting <src-arg|num> and
    <src-arg|den>. When the display style is turned of, then the arguments
    are rendered in script size. For instance, the content

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<frac|1|a<rsub|0>+<frac|1|a<rsub|1>+<frac|1|a<rsub|2>+\<ddots\>>>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    is rendered in display style as

    <\equation*>
      <frac|1|a<rsub|0>+<frac|1|a<rsub|1>+<frac|1|a<rsub|2>+\<ddots\>>>>
    </equation*>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|sqrt|content>

    <explain-macro|sqrt|content|n><explain-synopsis|roots>
  <|explain>
    The <markup|sqrt> primitive is used in order to render square roots like
    <with|mode|math|<sqrt|x>> or <src-arg|n>-th roots like
    <with|mode|math|<sqrt|x|3>>. The root symbol is automatically sized so as
    to encapsulate the <src-arg|content>:

    <\equation*>
      <sqrt|<frac|f(x)|y<rsup|2>+z<rsup|2>>|i+j>
    </equation*>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|lsub|script>

    <explain-macro|lsup|script>

    <explain-macro|rsub|script>

    <explain-macro|rsup|script><explain-synopsis|scripts>
  <|explain>
    These primitives are used in order to attach a <src-arg|script> to the
    preceeding box in a horizontal concatenation (in the case of right
    scripts) or the next one (in the case of left scripts). When there is no
    such box, then the script is attached to an empty box. Moreover, when
    both a subscript and a superscript are specified on the same side, then
    they are merged together. For instance, the expression

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<rsub|a><rsup|b>+<lsub|1><lsup|2>x<rsub|3><rsup|4>=y<rsub|1>+<lsub|c>>
    </tm-fragment>

    is rendered as

    <\equation*>
      <rsub|a><rsup|b>+<lsub|1><lsup|2>x<rsub|3><rsup|4>=y<rsub|1>+<lsub|c>
    </equation*>

    When a right script is attached to an operator (or symbol) which accepts
    limits, then it is rendered below or above instead of beside the
    operator:

    <\equation*>
      lim<rsub|n\<rightarrow\>\<infty\>>a<rsub|n><big|.>
    </equation*>

    Scripts are rendered in a smaller font in non-display style.
    Nevertheless, in order to keep formulas readable, the size is not reduced
    below script-script-size.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|lprime|prime-symbols>

    <explain-macro|rprime|prime-symbols><explain-synopsis|primes>
  <|explain>
    Left and right primes are similar to left and right superscripts, except
    that they behave in a different way when being edited. For instance, when
    your cursor is behind the prime symbol in <with|mode|math|f<rprime|'>>
    and you press backspace, then the prime is removed. If you are behind
    <with|mode|math|f<rsup|n>> and you press backspace several times, then
    you first enter the superscript, next remove <with|mode|math|n> and
    finally remove the superscript. Notice also that <src-arg|prime-symbols>
    is necessarily a string of concatenated prime symbols. For instance,
    <with|mode|math|f<rprime|'\<dag\>>> is represented by
    <inactive*|f<rprime|'\<dag\>>>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|below|content|script>

    <explain-macro|above|content|script><explain-synopsis|scripts above and
    below>
  <|explain>
    The <markup|below> and <markup|above> tags are used to explicitly attach
    a <src-arg|script> below or above a given <src-arg|content>. Both can be
    mixed in order to produce content with both a script below and above:

    <\equation*>
      <above|<below|xor|i=1>|\<infty\>> x<rsub|i>
    </equation*>

    can be produced using

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<above|<below|xor|i=1>|\<infty\>> x<rsub|i>>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|wide|content|wide-symbol>

    <explain-macro|wide*|content|wide-symbol><explain-synopsis|wide symbols>
  <|explain>
    These primitives can be used in order to produce wide accents above or
    below some mathematical <src-arg|content>. For instance
    <with|mode|math|<wide|x+y|\<bar\>>> corresponds to the markup
    <inactive*|<wide|x+y|\<bar\>>>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|neg|content><explain-synopsis|negations>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is mainly used for producing negated symbols or
    expressions, such as <with|mode|math|<neg|\<rightarrowtail\>>> or
    <with|mode|math|<neg|a>>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|tree|root|child-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|child-n><explain-synopsis|trees>
  <|explain>
    This primitive is used to produce a tree with a given <src-arg|root> and
    children <src-arg|child-1> until <src-arg|child-n>. The primitive should
    be used recursively in order to produce trees. For instance,

    <\equation*>
      <tree|+|x|y|<tree|\<times\>|2|y|z>>
    </equation*>

    corresponds to the markup

    <\tm-fragment>
      <inactive*|<tree|+|x|y|<tree|\<times\>|2|y|z>>>
    </tm-fragment>

    In the future, we plan to provide further style parameters in order to
    control the rendering.

  <tmdoc-title|Customizing the global rendering of titles>

  Depending on the kind of attributes, complex titles often use several
  rendering styles in a simultaneous version. More precisely, a title usually
  consists of the following parts:

  <\itemize>
    <item>A well visible part at the top of the title page.

    <item>Additional notes, which are displayed in the footer.

    <item>An potentially invisible part, with information like running titles
    and authors.

    <item>A postponed part, which is only rendered in the abstract.
  </itemize>

  Similarly, individual authors may also contain a main part, which is
  rendered as part of the title, and an additional part, which is rendered as
  a footnote. Moreover, the layout often changes if the paper has more than
  one author.

  The <TeXmacs> mechanism for rendering titles therefore relies on several
  macros which extract the information corresponding to each of the above
  parts. This process may also involve some sorting, like putting the authors
  before the date or <em|vice versa>. At a second stage, each extracted part
  of the title is passed to the appropriate rendering macro. The following
  macros are used for extracting title information:

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|doc-data-main|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>

    <explain-macro|doc-data-main*|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>
  <|explain>
    This macro only keeps and sorts the data which should be displayed in the
    main title. The <markup|doc-data-main*> variant is used in the case when
    the document has more than one author.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|doc-data-note|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>
  <|explain>
    This macro only keeps and sorts the data which should be displayed as a
    footnote.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|doc-data-abstract|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>
  <|explain>
    This macro only keeps and sorts the data which should be displayed in the
    abstract.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|doc-data-hidden|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>
  <|explain>
    This macro only keeps and sorts the data which might or should not be
    displayed at all.
  </explain>

  In a similar fashion, the following macros are used for extracting author
  information:

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|doc-author-main|<with|font-shape|right|<explain-macro|author-data|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>>>
  <|explain>
    This macro only keeps and sorts the data which should be displayed inside
    the main title.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|doc-author-note|data-1|<math|\<cdots\>>|data-n>
  <|explain>
    This macro only keeps and sorts the data which should be displayed as a
    footnote.
  </explain>

  It should be noticed that each of the above macros should return a
  <markup|document> tag with the selected data as its children. For instance,

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<style-with|src-compact|none|<doc-author-main|<author-affiliation|Somewhere
    in Africa>|<author-name|The big GNU>|<author-note|Very hairy indeed!>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  should typically return

  <\tm-fragment>
    <with|src-special|raw|<inactive*|<\style-with|src-compact|none>
      <author-affiliation|Somewhere in Africa>

      <author-name|The big GNU>
    </style-with>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  The only exception to this rule is <markup|doc-data-hidden> which should
  return a <markup|concat> tag instead.

  <tmdoc-title|Introduction on how to contribute>

  High quality documentation is both a matter of content and structure. The
  content itself has to be as pedagogic as possible for the targeted group of
  readers. In order to achieve this, you should not hesitate to provide
  enough examples and illustrative screen shots whenever adequate. Although
  the documentation is not necessarily meant to be complete, we do aim at
  providing relatively stable documentation. In particular, you should have
  checked your text against spelling errors.

  It is also important that you give your documentation as much structure as
  possible, using special markup from the <tmstyle|tmdoc> style file. This
  structure can be used in order to automatically compile printable books
  from your documentation, to make it suitable for different ways of viewing,
  or to make it possible to efficiently search a certain type of information
  in the documentation. In particular, you should always provide
  <hlink|copyright and license|copyright.en.tm><inactive|> information, as
  well as indications on how to <hlink|traverse|traversal.en.tm> your
  documentation, if it contains <hlink|many files|file-names.en.tm>.

  When selecting the <tmstyle|tmdoc> document style, the top level
  <menu|Manual> menu will appear automatically, together with some additional
  icons. The most important tags for documentation purposes can be found in
  this menu.

  <\warning>
    Don't forget to select <menu|Document|Language|Your language> for each
    translated file. This will cause some content to be translated
    automatically, like the menus or some names of keys. Also, we recommend
    to run the <TeXmacs> spell checker on each translated document; this also
    requires the prior selection of the right document language.

  <tmdoc-title|Customization of the environments for floating objects>

  The following macros can be used for customizing the rendering of
  figure-like environments:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-small-figure|aux|name|body|caption>>
    This macro is used for rendering small figure-like environments. The
    first argument <src-arg|aux> specifies an auxiliary channel (like
    ``figure'' or ``table'') which is used for inserting the caption inside
    the list of figures. The second argument <src-arg|name> specifies the
    name of the figure (like ``Figure 2.3'' or ``Table <no-break>5''). The
    last arguments <src-arg|body> and <src-arg|caption> correspond to the
    figure itself and a caption.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-big-figure|aux|name|body|caption>>
    Similar to <markup|render-small-figure>, but for displaying a big
    figure-like environments.
  </explain>

  The following tags can be used for customizing the appearance the text
  around figures, tables and footnotes:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|figure-name|name>>
    This macro controls the appearance of the text ``Figure''. By default, we
    use bold face.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|figure-sep>>
    This macro produces the separator between the figure and its number and
    the caption. By default, it produces a period followed by a space.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|footnote-sep>>
    This macro produces the separator between the number of the footnote and
    the text. By default, it produces a period followed by a space.

  <tmdoc-title|Standard headers>

  The <tmdtd|header> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides call-back macros which allow page
  headers and footers to change automatically when specifying the title
  information of the document or when starting a new section.

  <\explain|<explain-macro|header-title|title>>
    This macro is called when specifying the <src-arg|title> of a document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|header-author|author>>
    This macro is called when specifying the <src-arg|author>(s) of a
    document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|header-primary|section-title|section-nr|section-type>>
    This macro is called at the start of each new primary section
    (<abbr|e.g.> <markup|chapter> for book style, or <markup|section> for
    article style). The <src-arg|section-type> is a literal text like
    ``Chapter'' or ``Section''.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|header-secondary|section-title|section-nr|section-type>>
    This macro is called at the start of each new secondary section
    (<abbr|e.g.> <markup|section> for book style, or <markup|subsection> for
    article style). The <src-arg|section-type> is a literal text like
    ``Section'' or ``Paragraph''.
  </explain>

  In style files, page headers and footers are usually set by the above
  call-back macros, and not manually. You may directly modify headers and
  footers by setting the <hyper-link|corresponding environment
  variables|../../../devel/format/environment/env-page.en.tm#header-footer-env>
  or using several <hyper-link|helper macros|../std/std-utils-dtd.en.tm#header-footer-helper>
  supplied by <tmpackage|std-utils>.

<TeXmacs|1.0.7.20>

<style|tmdoc>

<\body>
  <tmdoc-title|Common errors and syntax correction>

  By default, the semantic editing mode ``understands'' most classical
  mathematical notations. This is achieved through the use of a carefully
  designed grammar for mainstream mathematics. Obviously, the use of a fixed
  grammar may cause the following problems:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Mathematical formulas frequently contain <em|ad hoc> notations. For
    instance, the formulas might contain some text or meaningful whitespace.
    Another example of an <em|ad hoc> notation is the sign sequence
    <math|++-+-+>. In such cases, the user should <hlink|explicitly
    annotate|man-semantic-annotation.en.tm> the appropriate parts of the
    formula in order to make them semantically meaningful.

    <item>The <TeXmacs> grammar used for the interpretation of mathematical
    formulas may be incomplete or inadequate for certain situations. It is
    possible to customize or extend the grammar using the standard <TeXmacs>
    macro mechanism. Notations for specific areas may be grouped together in
    dedicated style packages.
  </itemize>

  Besides these intrinsically hard to avoid problems, the following common
  and ``easy-to-make'' mistakes are a further source of trouble for
  associating semantics to mathematical formulas:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Since <TeXmacs> is a wysiwyg editor, some of the structure of the
    document is invisible for the user. For instance, the presence of a
    mathematical formula <math|x+y> is indicated through the use of an italic
    slant and special spacing. However, in the formula
    <math|f<around*|(|x|)>> it is easy to type the closing bracket outside
    the formula, with no visual difference.

    <item>Various mathematical notations are visually ambiguous. For
    instance, <math|a*<around*|(|b+c|)>> would usually be understood as
    <math|a\<cdot\><around*|(|b+c|)>>, whereas <math|f<around*|(|x+y|)>>
    rather corresponds to a function application. In the semantic editing
    mode, the user is expected to resolve this ambiguity by hand by entering
    multiplications using <key|*> and spaces using <key|space>. The
    multiply/apply ambiguity is one of the main sources of syntax errors,
    since many users do not pay attention to invisible differences.
    Similarly, the <math|\<wedge\>> glyph could be the ``logical and'' or the
    ``wedge product''. This ``homoglyph'' issue will be adressed in more
    detail in the section on the <hlink|semantics of mathematical
    symbols|man-semantics-symbols.en.tm>.\ 

    <item>It could be that a text was originally written in <LaTeX> or an old
    version of <TeXmacs>. In that case, the document contains no special
    indication on matching brackets or the scopes of big operators. For
    instance, in the formula <math|<around*|[|x,y|[>>, should we interpret
    the second bracket as a closing bracket? This is indeed the standard
    french notation for an interval with an open right end. More generally,
    all problems that we have mentioned so far tend to be present
    simultaneously when trying to associate semantics to existing documents.
  </itemize>

  After activation of the semantic editing mode, you may check whether a
  formula is correct by positioning your cursor inside it and looking at the
  color of the bounding box of the <hlink|semantic
  focus|man-semantics.en.tm#semantic-focus>: a<nbsp>green color corresponds
  to a correct formula and a<nbsp>red color indicates an error in the
  formula. Alternatively, assuming that the focus is on a mathematical
  formula, you may select <menu|Focus|Preferences|Highlight incorrect
  formulas>, in which all incorrect formulas are highlighted inside red
  boxes.

  For the second kind of ``easy-to-make'' errors, <TeXmacs> includes an
  automatic syntax corrector. Assuming that your cursor is inside a formula,
  you may use <menu|Edit|Correct|Correct all> for the correction of all
  formulas in your document, or the correction of the current selection. If
  the versioning tool is activated, then you may use
  <menu|Edit|Correct|Correct manually> to show the differences between the
  original and the corrected versions. You may then use the versioning tool
  to go through these differences and select the preferred versions.

  The precise algorithms which are used for the correction may be enabled or
  disabled from <menu|Edit|Preferences|Mathematics|Manual correction>:

  <\description>
    <item*|<menu|Remove superfluous invisible operators>>This algorithm is
    used in order to remove any superfluous function applications or
    multiplications. For instance, users who are accustomed to editing ASCII
    files often type spaces around binary infixes such as addition. Such
    ``function applications'' will be removed by this algorithm.

    <item*|<menu|Insert missing invisible operators>>In <LaTeX>,
    multiplications and function applications are never entered explicitly.
    When importing a <LaTeX> document, it is therefore important to detect
    and insert missing multiplications and function applications.

    <item*|<menu|Homoglyph substitutions>>This algorithm may perform some
    other useful substitutions of symbols by visually similar, but
    semantically distinct symbols. For instance, the backslash
    symbol<nbsp><math|\\> is replaced by the binary set differences infix (as
    in <math|X\<setminus\>Y>), whenever appropriate.
  </description>

  From the <menu|Edit|Preferences|Mathematics|Automatic correction>, you may
  also select those corrections algorithms which should be applied
  automatically whenever you open a file. The various corrections are always
  carried out when importing a <LaTeX> file.

  After syntax correction, the remaining errors indicate genuine typos at
  worst or non standard or non supported notations at best. We also notice
  that ``correct'' formulas do not necessarily have the intended meaning. In
  order to check whether the operators indeed apply to the intended
  arguments, you should keep an eye on the current focus while typing your
  formulas.\

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|doc-title-block|content>

    <explain-macro|doc-author-block|content>
  <|explain>
    Macros for rendering one component of the title or author information.
  </explain>

  The following macros may be used to customize the rendering of title
  information; notice that they are usually built on top of
  <markup|doc-title-block>.

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-make-title|content>>
    This macro is used for the rendering of the main title information.
    Usually, it contains at least the title itself, as well as one or several
    authors.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-render-title|title>>
    This macro is used for rendering the <src-arg|title> of the document. The
    <markup|doc-title> macro also takes care of rendering references to
    potential footnotes.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-subtitle|title>>
    This macro is used for rendering the <src-arg|subtitle> of the document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-doc-author|content>>
    In the case when the document has a single author, then this macro is
    used for rendering the <src-arg|content> information about him or her.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-doc-authors|content>>
    In the case when the document has several authors, then this macros is
    used for rendering all author-related <src-arg|content> which is part of
    the main title.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-date|date>>
    This macro is used for rendering the creation <src-arg|date> of the
    document.
  </explain>

  The following macros may be used to customize the rendering of author
  information; notice that they are usually built on top of
  <markup|doc-author-block>.

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-render-name|name>>
    Renders the <src-arg|name> of the author.The <markup|author-name> macro
    also takes care of rendering references to potential footnotes.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-by|name>>
    A macro which may put the text ``by '' in front of the <src-arg|name> of
    an author.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-affiliation|affiliation>>
    Renders the <src-arg|affiliation> of the author.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-email|email>>
    Renders the <src-arg|email> address of the author.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|author-homepage|email>>
    Renders the <src-arg|homepage> of the author.
  </explain>

  The following macros are used for information which is usually not rendered
  as a part of the main title, but rather as a footnote or part of the
  abstract.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|doc-title-note|note>

    <explain-macro|doc-author-note|note>
  <|explain>
    A macro for rendering a <src-arg|note> attached to the document or one of
    its authors. The note will usually appear as part of a footnote. By
    default, notes that consist of several lines are compressed into a single
    paragraph.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|doc-keywords|kw-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|kw-n>>
    A macro for displaying a list of keywords.

  <tmdoc-title|Plans for the future>

  There are many things that we would like to integrate in <TeXmacs>. On
  <hlink|<name|Savannah>|http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/texmacs/>, we
  maintain a<nbsp>wish list with <hlink|suggestions|http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/contact/wishes.en.html>
  by users and other detailed wanted features. Here follows an incomplete
  list of more general directions for future development, as on september 2,
  2011.

  <section|Typesetting>

  The typesetter should be reorganized and improved as follows:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Decouple the style-sheet language from the actual typesetter.

    <item>Better support for agglomerated documents (from physically
    different documents).

    <item>More types of dynamic objects, like animations, help balloons,
    <abbr|etc.>

    <item>Better line-breaking of large formulas.
  </itemize>

  <section|Extra facilities for editing texts>

  Although cursor movement, selections, etc. have already been implemented,
  some other standard editing facilities have not yet been completed. Let us
  mention a few of these:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Better search and replace tool for structured texts, formulas,
    certain environments etc. and regular expressions.

    <item>Mathematical facilities: simplification of a selected region,
    substitutions of formulas in other formulas, etc.

    <item>Version control.

    <item>Data compression and protection.

    <item>Grammar checkers and automatic translation programs. Does someone
    know where to find detailed free dictionaries and stuff like that?

    <item>Incorporation of a free speech recognition program.
  </itemize>

  <section|Converters to other formats>

  There is a constant need for good converters from and to other data
  formats:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Of course, <TeX>/<LaTeX> cannot really be considered as a format
    (it is really a language with an ill defined grammar). Nevertheless it is
    important to have good heuristic converters in both directions. We still
    would appreciate help in this direction, in particular in order to
    support standard documents styles of various journals.

    <item><TeXmacs> is also compatible with <name|Html>, but some things such
    as forms have not been implemented yet. The importation of tables could
    also be further improved and it would be nice if the importer could
    support cascaded style sheets.

    <item>It would be nice to have converters for the document formats used
    by <name|Open Office>, <name|Word>, and the internal formats used by
    important publishers such as <name|Elsevier>.

    <item>We would appreciate help for writing a converter from <TeXmacs> to
    the <name|Texinfo> format, which is the standard documentation format for
    the GNU project.
  </itemize>

  <section|Technical pictures>

  We have started to include a facility for drawing technical pictures, but
  the responsable developer (Henri <name|Lesourd>) is currently no longer
  part of the <TeXmacs> team. It would be nice to rewrite parts of the tool
  and extend it further so as to allow for the definition of graphical
  macros. This would allow users to define new geometrical constructions. It
  would for instance be possible to write a style file for drawing electronic
  circuits or chemical components with a nice icon bar for selecting circuits
  or components, just as you select lines and circles in usual pictures.

  <section|Tools for usage on the web and in networks>

  It would be nice to have a better integration of <TeXmacs> with the web. As
  a first step, we need a clean internal plug-in for <name|Wget> or
  <name|Curl> with support for cookies, security, etc. At a second stage, the
  Html converters should be improved to take advantage of this. After that,
  we may think about things like collaborative authoring via the web,
  integration with preprint servers, <abbr|etc.>

  Another interesting thing would be to incorporate tools for live
  conferencing inside <TeXmacs>. We actually expect this to be quite easy and
  this would open a different road towards collaborative authoring, instant
  messenging, <abbr|etc.>

  <section|Interface with computer algebra systems>

  The following improvements should still be made in order to link <TeXmacs>
  to computer algebra systems:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Improving the layout of computer algebra sessions.

    <item>Add extra features to increase the interoperability between
    <TeXmacs> and computer algebra systems and to give additional control
    over the layout of big output.

    <item>More semantics for the objects being communicated. This may either
    be high level information (like HTML 4.0 mathematical markup or Openmath)
    or low level information (including information about the representation
    of data), depending on the required speed.

    <item>Further possibilities for evolution concern syntax highlighting,
    debugging facilities and so on.
  </itemize>

    <explain-macro|date>

    <explain-macro|date|format>

    <explain-macro|date|format|language><explain-synopsis|obtain the current

  <|explain>
    Returns the current date in a specified <src-arg|format> (which defaults
    to a standard language-specific format when empty) and a specified
    <src-arg|language> (which defaults to English). The format is similar to
    the one used by the <name|Unix> <verbatim|date> command. For instance,
    <inactive*|<date>> evaluates to ``<date>'', <inactive*|<date||french>> to
    ``<date||french>'' and <inactive*|<date|%d %B om %k:%M|dutch>> to
    ``<date|%d %B om %k:%M|dutch>''.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|translate|what|from|into><explain-synopsis|translation of
    strings>
  <|explain>
    Returns the translation of a string <src-arg|what> of the language
    <src-arg|from> into the language <src-arg|into>, using the built-in
    <TeXmacs> dictionaries. The languages should be specified in lowercase
    letters. For instance, <inactive*|<translate|File|english|french>> yields
    ``<translate|File|english|french>''.

    The list of currently available languages can be checked in the
    <menu|Document|Language> menu. The built-in <TeXmacs> dictionaries can be
    found in

    <verbatim| \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/languages/natural/dic>

    When attempting to use a non-existing dictionary, the program may quit.
    For most purposes, it is more convenient to use the <markup|localize>
    <verbatim|>macro, which converts a string from English into the current
    language.

  <tmdoc-title|Notes for users of oriental languages>

  In order to type oriental languages, you first have to start a conversion
  server which can be used in combination with the X input method and set the
  environment variables accordingly. For instance, in the case of Japanese,
  one typically has to execute the folowing shell commands:

  <\shell-fragment>
    kinput2 &

    export LANG="ja_JP.eucJP"

    export LC_ALL="ja_JP.eucJP"

    export XMODIFIERS="@im=kinput2"
  </shell-fragment>

  You also have to install Japanese fonts. For instance, you may download the
  ipag fonts <verbatim|ipam.ttf>, <verbatim|ipag.ttf>, <verbatim|ipamp.ttf>,
  <verbatim|ipagm.ttf> and <verbatim|ipagui.ttf> and copy them to

  <verbatim| \ \ \ ~/.TeXmacs/fonts/truetype>

  After doing this, you may launch <TeXmacs> using

  <\shell-fragment>
    texmacs --delete-font-cache
  </shell-fragment>

  and select <menu|Japanese> from the <icon|tm_language.xpm> icon on the
  first icon bar. If everything went allright, the menus should now show up
  in Japanese and the current document is also in Japanese. Notice that you
  may also select Japanese as your default language in
  <menu|Edit|Preferences|Language|Japanese>. It is also possible to select
  Japanese for a portion of text in a document using
  <menu|Format|Language|Japanese>.

  Inside a Japanese portion of text, and depending on your input method, you
  usually have to type<nbsp><key|S-space> in order to start Kana to
  Kanji conversion. A small window shows up where you can type phonetic
  characters and use <key|space> in order to start conversion to Kanji
  characters. When pressing <shortcut|(kbd-return)>, the text is inserted into the
  main <TeXmacs> window. Pressing <key|S-space> once again returns to
  the classical <TeXmacs> input method.

  <tmdoc-title|XML serialization>

  For compatability reasons with the XML technology, <TeXmacs> also supports
  the serialization of <TeXmacs> documents in the XML format. However, the
  XML format is generally more verbose and less readable than the default
  <TeXmacs> format. In order to save or load a file in the XML format (using
  the <verbatim|.tmml> extension), you may use <menu|File|Export|XML>
  <abbr|resp.> <menu|File|Import|XML>.\ 

  It should be noticed that <TeXmacs> documents do not match a predefined
  DTD, since the appropriate DTD for a document depends on its style. The XML
  format therefore merely provides an XML representation for <TeXmacs> trees.
  The syntax has both been designed to be close to the tree structure and use
  conventional <acronym|XML> notations which are well supported by standard
  tools.

  <paragraph*|The encoding for strings>

  The leafs of <TeXmacs> trees are traslated from the universal <TeXmacs>
  encoding into Unicode. Characters without Unicode equivalents are
  represented as entities (in the future, we rather plan to create a
  <verbatim|tmsym> tag for representing such characters).

  <paragraph*|XML representation of regular tags>

  Trees with a single child are simply represented by the corresponding XML
  tag. In the case when a tree has several children, then each child is
  enclosed into a <verbatim|tm-arg> tag. For instance,
  <with|mode|math|<sqrt|x+y>> is simply represented as

  <\quote-env>
    <framed-fragment|<verbatim|\<less\>sqrt\<gtr\>y+z\<less\>/sqrt\<gtr\>>>
  </quote-env>

  whereas the fraction <with|mode|math|<frac|1|2>> is represented as

  <\quote-env>
    <\framed-fragment>
      <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
        <\verbatim>
          \<less\>frac\<gtr\>

          \ \ \<less\>tm-arg\<gtr\>1\<less\>/tm-arg\<gtr\>

          \ \ \<less\>tm-arg\<gtr\>2\<less\>/tm-arg\<gtr\>

          \<less\>/frac\<gtr\>
        </verbatim>
      </with>
    </framed-fragment>
  </quote-env>

  In the above example, the whitespace is ignored. Whitespace may be
  preserved by setting the standard <verbatim|xml:space> attribute to
  <verbatim|preserve>.

  <paragraph*|Special tags>

  Some tags are represented in a special way in XML. The <markup|concat> tag
  is simply represented by a textual concatenation. For instance,
  <with|mode|math|<frac|1|2>+<sqrt|x+y>> is represented as

  <\quote-env>
    <framed-fragment|<\verbatim>
      \<less\>frac\<gtr\>\<less\>tm-arg\<gtr\>1\<less\>/tm-arg\<gtr\>\<less\>tm-arg\<gtr\>2\<less\>/tm-arg\<gtr\>\<less\>/frac\<gtr\>+\<less\>sqrt\<gtr\>y+z\<less\>/sqrt\<gtr\>
    </verbatim>>
  </quote-env>

  The <markup|document> tag is not explicitly exported. Instead, each
  paragraph argument is enclosed within a <verbatim|tm-par> tag. For
  instance, the quotation

  <\quote-env>
    Ik ben de blauwbilgorgel.

    Als ik niet wok of worgel,
  </quote-env>

  is represented as

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\with|par-par-sep|0fn>
      <\verbatim>
        \<less\>quote-env\<gtr\>

        \ \ \<less\>tm-par\<gtr\>

        \ \ \ \ Ik ben de blauwbilgorgel.

        \ \ \<less\>/tm-par\<gtr\>

        \ \ \<less\>tm-par\<gtr\>

        \ \ \ \ Als ik niet wok of worgel,

        \ \ \<less\>/tm-par\<gtr\>

        \<less\>/quote-env\<gtr\>
      </verbatim>
    </with>
  </tm-fragment>

  A <markup|with> tag with only string attributes and values is represented
  using the standard XML attribute notation. For instance, ``some
  <with|color|blue|blue> text'' would be represented as

  <\quote-env>
    <framed-fragment|<\verbatim>
      some \<less\>with color="blue"\<gtr\>blue\<less\>/with\<gtr\> text
    </verbatim>>
  </quote-env>

  Conversily, <TeXmacs> provides the <markup|attr> primitive in order to
  represent attributes of XML tags. For instance, the XML fragment

  <\quote-env>
    <framed-fragment|<\verbatim>
      some \<less\>mytag beast="heary"\<gtr\>special\<less\>/mytag\<gtr\>
      text
    </verbatim>>
  </quote-env>

  would be imported as ``<inactive*|some <my-tag|<attr|beast|heary>|special>
  text>''. This will make it possible, in principle, to use <TeXmacs> as an
  editor of general XML files.

  <tmdoc-title|Basic input/output using pipes>

  The configuration and the compilation of the <verbatim|minimal> plug-in is
  <hlink|described|../plugin/plugin-binary.en.tm> in the chapter about
  plug-ins. We will now study the source file
  <example-plugin-link|minimal/src/minimal.cpp>. Essentially, the
  <verbatim|main> routine is given by

  <\cpp-code>
    int

    main () {

    \ \ <em|display-startup-banner>

    \ \ while (true) {

    \ \ \ \ <em|read-input>

    \ \ \ \ <em|display-output>

    \ \ }

    \ \ return 0;

    }
  </cpp-code>

  By default, <TeXmacs> just send a <verbatim|'\\n'>-terminated string to the
  application as the input. Consequently, the code for
  <verbatim|<em|read-input>> is given by

  <\cpp-code>
    char buffer[100];

    cin.getline (buffer, 100, '\\n');
  </cpp-code>

  The output part is more complicated, since <TeXmacs> needs to have a secure
  way for knowing whether the output has finished. This is accomplished by
  encapsulating each piece of output (in our case both the display banner and
  the interactive output) inside a block of the form

  <\quotation>
    <framed-fragment|<verbatim|<render-key|DATA_BEGIN><em|format>:<em|message><render-key|DATA_END>>>
  </quotation>

  Here <verbatim|DATA_BEGIN> and <verbatim|DATA_END> stand for special
  control characters:

  <\cpp-code>
    #define DATA_BEGIN \ \ ((char) 2)

    #define DATA_END \ \ \ \ ((char) 5)

    #define DATA_ESCAPE \ ((char) 27)
  </cpp-code>

  The <verbatim|DATA_ESCAPE> is used for producing the <verbatim|DATA_BEGIN>
  and <verbatim|DATA_END> characters in the <verbatim|<em|message>> using the
  rewriting rules

  <\quotation>
    <\framed-fragment>
      <\with|font-family|tt>
        <tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<render-key|DATA_ESCAPE><space|0.6spc><render-key|DATA_BEGIN>>|<cell|<math|\<longrightarrow\>>>|<cell|<render-key|DATA_BEGIN>>>|<row|<cell|<render-key|DATA_ESCAPE><space|0.6spc><render-key|DATA_END>>|<cell|<math|\<longrightarrow\>>>|<cell|<render-key|DATA_END>>>|<row|<cell|<render-key|DATA_ESCAPE><space|0.6spc><render-key|DATA_ESCAPE>>|<cell|<math|\<longrightarrow\>>>|<cell|<render-key|DATA_ESCAPE>>>>>>
      </with>
    </framed-fragment>
  </quotation>

  The <verbatim|<em|format>> specifies the format of the
  <verbatim|<em|message>>. For instance, in our example, the code of
  <verbatim|<em|display-startup-banner>> is given by

  <\cpp-code>
    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "verbatim:";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "Hi there!";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  Similarly, the code of <verbatim|<em|display-output>> is given by

  <\cpp-code>
    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "verbatim:";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "You typed " \<less\>\<less\> buffer;

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  <\remark>
    For synchronization purposes, <TeXmacs> will assume that the output is
    finished as soon as it encounters the <render-key|DATA_END> which closes
    the initial <render-key|DATA_BEGIN>. So all output has to be inside one
    <em|single> outer <render-key|DATA_BEGIN>-<render-key|DATA_END> block: if
    you send more blocks, then <TeXmacs> will retake control before reading
    all your output. For certain formats (such as <verbatim|verbatim>), it
    <em|is> possible to nest <render-key|DATA_BEGIN>-<render-key|DATA_END>
    blocks though, as we will see below.
  </remark>

  <\remark>
    In our example, the <c++> code for the application is included in the
    plug-in. In the case when you are writing a <TeXmacs> interface for an
    existing application <verbatim|<em|myapp>>, the convention is to create a
    <verbatim|--texmacs> option for this program. Then it is no longer
    necessary to have <verbatim|<em|myapp>/src> and <verbatim|<em|myapp>/bin>
    directories for your plug-in and it suffices to configure the plug-in by
    putting something like the following in
    <verbatim|<em|myapp>/progs/init-<em|myapp>.scm>:

    <\scm-code>
      (plugin-configure <em|myapp>

      \ \ (:require (url-exists-in-path? "<em|myapp>"))

      \ \ (:launch "<em|myapp> --texmacs")

      \ \ (:session "<em|Myapp>"))
    </scm-code>

    In the case when you do not have the possibility to modify the source
    code of <verbatim|<em|myapp>>, you typically have to write an
    input/output filter <verbatim|tm_<em|myapp>> for performing the
    appropriate rewritings. By looking at the standard plug-ins distributed
    with <TeXmacs> in

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ $TEXMACS_PATH/plugins
    </verbatim>

    you can find several examples of how this can be done.

  <tmdoc-title|Mathematical and customized input>

  The <TeXmacs> meta-format allows application output to contain structured
  text like mathematical formulas. In a similar way, you may use general
  <TeXmacs> content as the input for your application. By default, only the
  text part of such content is kept and sent to the application as a string.
  Moreover, all characters in the range 0--31 are ignored, except for
  <verbatim|'\\t'> and <verbatim|'\\n'> which are transformed into spaces.
  There are two methods to customize the way input is sent to your
  application. First of all, the configuration option

  <\scm-code>
    (:serializer ,<em|routine>)
  </scm-code>

  specifies a scheme function for converting <TeXmacs> trees to string input
  for your application, thereby overriding the default method. This method
  allows you for instance to treat multi-line input in a particular way or
  the perform transformations on the <TeXmacs> tree.

  The <scm|:serialize> option is a very powerful, but also a very abstract
  way to customize input: it forces you to write a complete input
  transformation function. In many circumstances, the user really wants to
  rewrite two dimensional mathematical input to a more standard form, like
  rewriting <no-break><math|<frac|a|b>> to <verbatim|((a)/(b))>. Therefore, a
  second way for customizing the input is to use the command

  <\scm-code>
    \ (plugin-input-converters <em|myplugin>

    \ \ \ <em|rules>)
  </scm-code>

  This command specifies input conversion rules for <verbatim|<em|myplugin>>
  for ``mathematical input'' and reasonable defaults are provided by
  <TeXmacs>. Each rule is of one of the following two forms:

  <\description>
    <item*|Leaf transformation rules>

    Given two strings <verbatim|<em|symbol>> and <verbatim|<em|conversion>>,
    the rule

    <\scm-code>
      (<verbatim|<em|symbol>> <verbatim|<em|conversion>>)
    </scm-code>

    specifies that the <TeXmacs> symbol <verbatim|<em|symbol>> should be
    converted to <verbatim|<em|conversion>>.

    <item*|Tag transformation rules>

    Given a symbol <verbatim|<em|tag>> and a <scheme> function
    <verbatim|<em|routine>>, the rule

    <\scm-code>
      (<em|tag> <em|routine>)
    </scm-code>

    specifies that <verbatim|<em|routine>> will be used as the conversion
    routine for <verbatim|<em|tag>>. This routine should just write a string
    to the standard output. The <scheme> function <scm|plugin-input> may be
    used for the recursive transformation of the arguments of the tag.
  </description>

  <paragraph*|The <verbatim|input> plug-in>

  The <verbatim|input> plug-in demonstrates the use of customized
  mathematical input. It consists of the files

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|input/Makefile>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|input/packages/session/input.ts>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|input/progs/init-input.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|input/progs/input-input.scm>

    \ \ \ \ <example-plugin-link|input/src/input.cpp>
  </verbatim>

  The <scheme> configuration code in <verbatim|init-input.scm> is given by

  <\scm-code>
    (plugin-configure input

    \ \ (:require (url-exists-in-path? "input.bin"))

    \ \ (:launch "input.bin")

    \ \ (:session "Input"))

    \;

    (when (supports-initialize?)

    \ \ (lazy-input-converter (input-input) input))
  </scm-code>

  The predicate <verbatim|supports-initialize?> tests whether the plug-in is
  indeed operational (that is, whether <verbatim|input.bin> exists in the
  path). The conversion rules in the module <verbatim|(input input)> are
  added in a lazy manner. In other words, the file <verbatim|input-input.scm>
  will only be loaded when we explicitly request to make a conversion. The
  conversion rules in <verbatim|input-input.scm> are given by

  <\scm-code>
    (plugin-input-converters input

    \ \ (frac input-input-frac)

    \ \ (special input-input-special)

    \ \ ("\<less\>vee\<gtr\>" "\|\|")

    \ \ ("\<less\>wedge\<gtr\>" "&&"))
  </scm-code>

  This will cause <math|\<vee\>> and <math|\<wedge\>> to be rewritten as
  <verbatim|\|\|> and <verbatim|&&> respectively. Fractions <math|<frac|a|b>>
  are rewritten as <verbatim|((a):(b))> using the routine

  <\scm-code>
    (define (input-input-frac t)

    \ \ (display "((")

    \ \ (plugin-input (car t))

    \ \ (display "):(")

    \ \ (plugin-input (cadr t))

    \ \ (display "))"))
  </scm-code>

  In the additional style file <verbatim|input.ts> we also defined some
  additional markup <markup|special>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|special|<macro|body|<block|<tformat|<cwith|1|1|1|1|cell-background|pastel
    green>|<table|<row|<cell|<arg|body>>>>>>>>>
  </tm-fragment>

  This tag is rewritten using the special conversion rule

  <\scm-code>
    (define (input-input-special t)

    \ \ (display "[[[SPECIAL:")

    \ \ (plugin-input (car t))

    \ \ (display "]]]"))
  </scm-code>

  As to the <c++> code in <verbatim|input.cpp>, the startup banner
  automatically puts the shell session in mathematical input mode:

  <\cpp-code>
    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "verbatim:";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\>
    "command:(session-use-math-input #t)"

    \ \ \ \ \ \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout \<less\>\<less\> "Convert mathematical input into plain text";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  In the main loop, we content ourselves the reproduce the input as output:

  <\cpp-code>
    char buffer[100];

    cin.getline (buffer, 100, '\\n');

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_BEGIN \<less\>\<less\> "verbatim:";

    cout \<less\>\<less\> buffer;

    cout \<less\>\<less\> DATA_END;

    cout.flush ();
  </cpp-code>

  <tmdoc-title|Indentation primitives>

  There are two main ways to distinguish between successive paragraphs:
  separate them by a small vertical space, or use an indentation for each new
  paragraph. The indentation can be explicitly controlled using the
  <markup|no-indent>, <markup|yes-indent>, <markup|no-indent*> and
  <markup|yes-indent*> tags. The <markup|no-indent> and <markup|yes-indent>
  primitives apply to the current paragraph, while the <markup|no-indent*>
  and <markup|yes-indent*> apply the next paragraph.

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|no-indent>

    <explain-macro|yes-indent>
  <|explain>
    Disable or enable indentation for the current paragraph. For instance,
    the code

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\inactive*>
        <no-indent>This is a long paragraph which demonstrates the disabling
        indentation using the <markup|no-indent> primitive.

        <yes-indent>This is a long paragraph which demonstrates enabling
        indentation using the <markup|yes-indent> primitive.
      </inactive*>
    </tm-fragment>

    typically produces

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\with|par-first|2fn>
        <no-indent>This is a long paragraph which demonstrates the disabling
        indentation using the <markup|no-indent> primitive.

        <yes-indent>This is a long paragraph which demonstrates enabling
        indentation using the <markup|yes-indent> primitive.
      </with>
    </tm-fragment>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|no-indent*>

    <explain-macro|yes-indent*>
  <|explain>
    Disable or enable indentation for the next paragraph. For instance,

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\inactive*>
        A first paragraph.<yes-indent*>

        A second paragraph.
      </inactive*>
    </tm-fragment>

    typically produces

    <\tm-fragment>
      <\with|par-first|2fn>
        A first paragraph.<yes-indent*>

        A second paragraph.
      </with>
    </tm-fragment>

    Notice that <markup|no-indent> and <markup|yes-indent> override
    <markup|no-indent*> and <markup|yes-indent*> directives in the previous
    paragraph.

    Currently, the <markup|no-indent*> and <markup|yes-indent*> tags are
    mainly used in order to control the indentation after section titles or
    environments like <markup|equation> which usually correspond to paragraph
    units. In the future, when sectional tags will take the section bodies as
    arguments, and when the <markup|paragraph> tag will be correctly
    implemented, the <markup|no-indent*> and <markup|yes-indent*> will become
    deprecated.

  <with|font-shape|italic|><tmdoc-title|Adding new data formats and
  converters>

  Using the <name|Guile>/<name|Scheme> extension language, it is possible to
  add new data formats and converters to <TeXmacs> in a modular way. Usually,
  the additional formats and converters are declared in your personal
  <verbatim|~/.TeXmacs/progs/my-init-texmacs.scm> or a dedicated plug-in.
  Some examples may be found in the directory
  <verbatim|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/convert>, like
  <hlink|init-html.scm|$TEXMACS_PATH/progs/convert/html/init-html.scm>.

  <paragraph*|Declaring new formats>

  A new format is declared using the command

  <\scm-code>
    (define-format <em|format>

    \ \ (:name <em|format-name>)

    \ \ <em|options>)
  </scm-code>

  Here <verbatim|<em|format>> is a symbol which stands for the format and
  <verbatim|<em|format-name>> a string which can be used in menus. In fact, a
  data format usually comes in several variants: a format
  <verbatim|<em|format>-file> for files, a format
  <verbatim|<em|format>-document> for entire documents, a format
  <verbatim|<em|format>-snippet> for snippets, like selections, and
  <verbatim|<em|format>-object> for the preferred internal scheme
  representation for doing conversions (<abbr|i.e.> the parsed variant of the
  format). Converters from <verbatim|<em|format>-file> to
  <verbatim|<em|format>-document> and <em|vice versa> are provided
  automatically.

  The user may specify additional options for the automatic recognition of
  formats by their file suffix and contents. The possible suffixes for a
  format, with the default one listed first, may be specified using

  <\scm-code>
    (:suffix <em|default-suffix> <em|other-suffix-1> ... <em|other-suffix-n>)
  </scm-code>

  A (heuristic) routine for recognizing whether a given document matches the
  format can be specified using either one of the following:

  <\scm-code>
    (:recognize <em|predicate>)

    (:must-recognize <em|predicate>)
  </scm-code>

  In the first case, suffix recognition takes precedence over document
  recognition and in the second case, the heuristic recognition is entirely
  determined by the document recognition predicate.

  A format can be removed from menus using the following:

  <\scm-code>
    (:hidden)
  </scm-code>

  <paragraph*|Declaring new converters>

  New converters are declared using

  <\scm-code>
    (converter <em|from> <em|to>

    \ \ <em|options>)
  </scm-code>

  The actual converter is specified using either one of the following
  options:

  <\scm-code>
    (:function <em|converter>)

    (:function-with-options <em|converter-with-options>)

    (:shell <em|prog> <em|prog-pre-args> from <em|progs-infix-args> to
    <em|prog-post-args>)
  </scm-code>

  In the first case, the <verbatim|<em|converter>> is a routine which takes
  an object of the <verbatim|<em|from>> format and returns a routine of the
  <verbatim|<em|to>> format. In the second case, the
  <verbatim|<em|converter>> takes an additional association list as its
  second argument with options for the converter. In the last case, a shell
  command is specified in order to convert between two file formats. The
  converter is activated only then, when <verbatim|<em|prog>> is indeed found
  in the path. Also, auxiliary files may be created and destroyed
  automatically.

  <TeXmacs> automatically computes the transitive closure of all converters
  using a shortest path algorithm. In other words, if you have a converter
  from <math|x> to <math|y> and a converter from <math|y> to <math|z>, then
  you will automatically have a converter from <math|x> to <math|z>. A
  ``distance between two formats via a given converter'' may be specified
  using

  <\scm-code>
    (:penalty <em|floating-point-distance>)
  </scm-code>

  Further options for converters are:

  <\scm-code>
    (:require <em|cond>)

    (:option <em|option> <em|default-value>)
  </scm-code>

  The first option specifies a condition which must be satisfied for this
  converter to be used. This option should be specified as the first or
  second option and always after the <verbatim|:penalty> option. The
  <verbatim|:option> option specifies an option for the converter with its
  default value. This option automatically become a user preference and it
  will be passed to all converters with options.

  <tmdoc-title|Miscellaneous physical markup>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|rigid|content><explain-synopsis|atomic entity>
  <|explain>
    Typeset the <src-arg|content>, which must be <re-index|line content>, as
    an atomic line item. Hyphenation within the <markup|rigid> and special
    spacing handling on its borders are disabled.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|float|type|where|body><explain-synopsis|floating page
    insertion>
  <|explain>
    Floating insertions are page items which are typeset ``out of band'',
    they are associated to two boxes: the anchor box marks the structural
    position of the <markup|float>, the floating box contains the typeset
    <src-arg|body> operand. This facility is used by footnotes and floating
    blocks.

    The first and second operands are evaluated, but for clarity the first
    operand appears as a literal string in the examples. Since the
    <src-arg|body> is typeset out of band, it may be <re-index|block content>
    even if the <markup|float> occurs in <re-index|line context>.

    <\indent>
      <explain-macro|float|<src-value|footnote>||body> produces a footnote
      insertion, this should only be used within the <markup|footnote> macro
      and is considered style markup. The floating box of a footnote is
      typeset at the end of the the page containing the anchor box.

      <explain-macro|float|<src-value|float>|where|body> produces a floating
      block, this is considered physical markup. The position of the floating
      box is chosen by the page breaker, which uses this extra freedom to
      minimize the page breaking penalty.

      The <src-arg|where> operand must evaluate to a string which may contain
      the following characters:

      <\description>
        <item*|t>Allow the floating box at page <em|top>.

        <item*|b>Allow the floating box at page <em|bottom>.

        <item*|h>Allow the floating box ``<em|here>'', in the middle of the
        page near the anchor box.

        <item*|f><em|Force> the floating box within the same page as the
        anchor box.
      </description>
    </indent>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|specific|medium|body><explain-synopsis|medium-specific
    content>
  <|explain>
    This primitive marks <src-arg|body> for output only on the specified
    <src-arg|medium>. The following values of <src-arg|medium> are supported:

    <\description>
      <item*|texmacs>The <src-arg|body> is typeset as usual line content.

      <item*|latex>The <src-arg|body>, which must be a string, is not visible
      from within <TeXmacs>, but it will be included in a verbatim way when
      the document is exported to <LaTeX>.

      <item*|html>Similar to the <verbatim|latex> medium, but for <name|HTML>
      exports.

      <item*|screen>The <src-arg|body> is only typeset when the document is
      visualized on a screen. This may be useful to provide additional visual
      information to the user during the editing phase which should disappear
      when printing out. A similar tag which may be used for this purpose is
      <markup|flag>.

      <item*|printer>This medium is complementary to <verbatim|screen>, when
      the <src-arg|body> should only be visible when printing out, but not
      when the document is displayed on the screen.
    </description>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|raw-data|data><explain-synopsis|binary content>>
    In some contexts you need to embed uneditable data inside a document,
    most of the time this is uneditable binary data. The <markup|raw-data>
    primitive makes it impossible to view or modify its subtree from within
    the editor.

  <tmdoc-title|Customizing the general layout>

  The general layout of a document is mainly modified by setting the
  appropriate environment variables for <hyper-link|page
  layout|../../format/environment/env-page.en.tm> and <hyper-link|paragraph
  layout|../../format/environment/env-par.en.tm>. For instance, by including
  the following lines in your style file, you can set the page size to
  <verbatim|letter> and the left and right margins to <verbatim|2in>:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <assign|page-type|letter>

      <assign|page-odd|2in>

      <assign|page-even|2in>

      <assign|page-right|2in>
    </inactive*>
  </tm-fragment>

  It should be noticed that the environment variables for page layout are
  quite different in <TeXmacs> and <TeX>/<LaTeX>. In order to make it easier
  to adapt <LaTeX> style files to <TeXmacs>, we have therefore provided the
  <tmpackage|std-latex> package, which emulates the environment variables
  from <TeX>/<LaTeX>. Typically, this allows you determine the global layout
  by lines like

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <assign|tex-odd-side-margin|<macro|20pt>>

      <assign|tex-even-side-margin|<macro|20pt>>

      <assign|tex-text-width|<macro|33pc>>
    </inactive*>
  </tm-fragment>

  We notice that macros which return lengths are considered as
  <hyper-link|lengths|../../format/basics/lengths.en.tm> themselves. In the
  case of the <TeX>/<LaTeX> emulation package, we actually <em|require> all
  lengths to be macros.

  The page headers and footers are usually not determined by global
  environment variables or macros, since they may change when a new chapter
  or section is started. Instead, <TeXmacs> provides the call-back macros
  <markup|header-title>, <markup|header-author>, <markup|header-primary> and
  <markup|header-secondary>. These macros are called when the document title
  or author are specified or when a new primary or secondary section is
  started (primary sections are typically chapters in books, or sections in
  articles). For instance, the following redefinition makes the principal
  section name appear on even pages, together with the current page number
  and a wide underline.

  <\tm-fragment>
    <inactive*|<assign|header-primary|<macro|title|nr|type|<assign|page-even-header|<quasiquote|<style-with|src-compact|none|<wide-std-underlined|<style-with|src-compact|none|<page-the-page><htab|5mm><unquote|<arg|title>>>>>>>>>>

  <tmdoc-title|Customizing arbitrary tags>

  Imagine that you want to change the rendering of a given tag, like
  <markup|lemma>. As a general rule, <TeXmacs> provides a set of well-chosen
  macros which can be customized by the user so as to obtain the desired
  effect. For instance, as we have seen <hyper-link|above|../customize/customize-theorems.en.tm>,
  you should use modify one of the macros <markup|render-theorem>,
  <markup|theorem-name> or <markup|theorem-sep> in order to customize the
  rendering of <markup|lemma> and all other theorem-like environments.

  However, in some cases, it may not be clear which ``well-chosen'' macro to
  customize. If we just wanted to change the presentation of lemmas and not
  of any other theorem-like environments, then we clearly cannot modify
  <markup|render-theorem>, <markup|theorem-name> or <markup|theorem-sep>. In
  other cases, the user may not want to invest his time in completely
  understanding the macro hierarchy of <TeXmacs>, and find out about the
  existence of <markup|render-theorem>, <markup|theorem-name> and
  <markup|theorem-sep>.

  So imagine that you want all lemmas to appear in red. One thing \ you can
  always do is copy the original definition of lemmas in a safe place and
  redefine the lemma macro on top of the original definition:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <assign|orig-lemma|<value|lemma>>

      <assign|lemma|<macro|body|<with|color|red|<orig-lemma|<arg|body>>>>>
    </inactive*>
  </tm-fragment>

  Alternatively, if only the text inside the lemma should be rendered in red,
  then you may do:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <assign|orig-lemma|<value|lemma>>

      <assign|lemma|<macro|body|<orig-lemma|<with|color|red|<arg|body>>>>>
    </inactive*>
  </tm-fragment>

  Of course, you have to be careful that the name <markup|orig-lemma> is not
  already in use.

  Another frequent situation is that you only want to modify the rendering of
  a tag when it is used inside another one. On the web, the <em|Cascading
  Style Sheet> language (<acronym|CSS>) provides a mechanism for doing this.
  In <TeXmacs>, you may simulate this behaviour by redefining macros inside a
  <markup|with>. For instance, imagine that we want the inter-paragraph space
  inside lists inside theorem-like environments to vanish. Then we may use:

  <\tm-fragment>
    <\inactive*>
      <assign|orig-render-theorem|<value|render-theorem>>

      <assign|render-theorem|<macro|name|body|<with|orig-render-list|<value|render-list>|<with|render-list|<macro|x|<with|par-par-sep|0fn|<orig-render-list|<arg|x>>>>|<style-with|src-compact|none|<orig-render-theorem|<arg|name>|<arg|body>>>>>>>
    </inactive*>
  </tm-fragment>

  On the one hand side, this mechanism is a bit more complex than
  <acronym|CSS>, where it suffices to respecify the <src-var|par-par-sep>
  attribute of lists inside theorems. On the other hand, it is also more
  powerful, since the <markup|render-theorem> macro applies to all
  theorem-like environments at once. Furthermore, if the above mechanism is
  to be used frequently, then real hackers may simplify the notations using
  further macro magic.

  <tmdoc-title|Selection of subexpressions>

  Besides pattern matching on trees, <TeXmacs> provides the routine
  <scm|select> for pattern matching along paths. Given a tree, this mechanism
  typically allows the user to select all subtrees which are reached
  following a path which meets specific criteria. For instance, one might to
  select the second child of the last child or all square roots inside
  numerators of fractions. The syntax of the selection patterns is also used
  for high level tree accessors.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(select <scm-arg|expr> <scm-arg|pattern>)><explain-synopsis|select
    subexpressions following a pattern>
  <|explain>
    Select all subtrees inside a hybrid tree <scm-arg|expr> according to a
    specific path <scm-arg|pattern>.
  </explain>

  Patterns are lists of atomic patterns of one of the following forms:

  <\explain>
    <scm|0>, <scm|1>, <scm|2>, ...<explain-synopsis|select a specific child>
  <|explain>
    Given an integer <scm|n>, select the <scm|n>-th child of the input tree.
    For instance, <scm|(select '(frac "1" "2") '(0))> returns <scm|("1")>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:first>, <scm|:last><explain-synopsis|select first or last child>
  <|explain>
    Select first or last child of the input tree.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:range <scm-arg|start> <scm-arg|end>)><explain-synopsis|select
    children in a range>
  <|explain>
    Select all children in a specified range.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm-arg|label><explain-synopsis|select children with a given label>
  <|explain>
    Select all compound subtrees with the specified <scm-arg|label>. Example:

    <\session|scheme|default>
      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (select '(document (strong "x") (math "a+b") (strong "y")) '(strong))
      <|unfolded-io>
        ((strong "x") (strong "y"))
      </unfolded-io>
    </session>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:%1>, <scm|:%2>, <scm|:%3>, ...<explain-synopsis|select descendants
    of a given generation>
  <|explain>
    The pattern <scm|:%n>, where <scm|n> is a number, selects all descendants
    of the <scm|n>-th generation. Example:

    <\session|scheme|default>
      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (select '(foo (bar "x" "y") (slash (dot))) '(:%2))
      <|unfolded-io>
        ("x" "y" (dot))
      </unfolded-io>
    </session>
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:*><explain-synopsis|select all descendants>
  <|explain>
    This pattern selects all descendants of the tree. For instance,
    <scm|(select t '(:* frac 0 :* sqrt))> selects all square roots inside
    numerators of fractions inside <scm|t>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:match <scm-arg|pattern>)><explain-synopsis|matching>
  <|explain>
    This pattern matches the input tree if and only the input tree matches
    the specified <scm-arg|pattern> according to <scm|match?>. Example:

    <\session|scheme|default>
      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (select '(foo "x" (bar)) '(:%1 (:match :string?)))
      <|unfolded-io>
        ("x")
      </unfolded-io>
    </session>

    Example with creation of a custom predicate:

    <\session|scheme|default>
      <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
        (select '(foo "x" (bar)) '(:* (:match :tree-atomic?)))
      <|unfolded-io>
        ()
      </unfolded-io>

      <\input|Scheme] >
        \;
      </input>
    </session>

    List of useful predicates:
  </explain>

  \;

  <\explain>
    <scm|(:or <scm-arg|pattern-1> ... <scm-arg|pattern-n>)>

    <scm|(:and <scm-arg|pattern-1> ... <scm-arg|pattern-n>)><explain-synopsis|boolean
    expressions>
  <|explain>
    These rules allow for the selection of all subtrees which satisfy one
    among or all patterns <scm-arg|pattern-1> until <scm-arg|pattern-n>.
  </explain>

  In the case when the input tree is active, the function <scm|select>
  supports some additional patterns which allow the user to navigate inside
  the tree.

  <\explain>
    <scm|:up><explain-synopsis|parent>
  <|explain>
    This pattern selects the parent of the input tree, if it exists.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:down><explain-synopsis|child containing the cursor>
  <|explain>
    If the cursor is inside some child of the input tree, then this pattern
    will select this child.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:next><explain-synopsis|next child>
  <|explain>
    If the input tree is the <math|i>-th child of its parent, then this
    pattern will select the <math|<around|(|i+1|)>>-th child.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|:previous><explain-synopsis|previous child>
  <|explain>
    If the input tree is the <math|i>-th child of its parent, then this
    pattern will select the <math|<around|(|i-1|)>>-th child.

  <tmdoc-title|<TeXmacs> documents>

  Whereas <TeXmacs> document fragments can be general <TeXmacs> trees,
  <TeXmacs> documents are trees of a special form which we will describe now.
  The root of a <TeXmacs> document is necessarily a <markup|document> tag.
  The children of this tag are necessarily of one of the following forms:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|TeXmacs|version><explain-synopsis|<TeXmacs>
  version>>
    This mandatory tag specifies the version of <TeXmacs> which was used to
    save the document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|project|ref><explain-synopsis|part of a project>>
    An optional project to which the document belongs.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|style|version>

    <explain-macro|style|<with|font-shape|right|<explain-macro|tuple|style|pack-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|pack-n>>><explain-synopsis|style
    and packages>
  <|explain>
    An optional style and additional packages for the document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|body|content><explain-synopsis|body of the
  document>>
    This mandatory tag specifies the body of your document.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<label|initial-env><explain-macro|initial|table><explain-synopsis|initial
  environment>>
    Optional specification of the initial environment for the document, with
    information about the page size, margins, <abbr|etc.>. The
    <src-arg|table> is of the form <explain-macro|collection|binding-1|<with|mode|math|\<cdots\>>|binding-n>.
    Each <src-arg|binding-<no-break>i> is of the form
    <explain-macro|associate|var-i|val-i> and associates the initial value
    <src-arg|val-i> to the environment variable <src-arg|var-i>. The initial
    values of environment variables which do not occur in the table are
    determined by the style file and packages.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|references|table><explain-synopsis|references>>
    An optional list of all valid references to labels in the document. Even
    though this information can be automatically recovered by the typesetter,
    this recovery requires several passes. In order to make the behaviour of
    the editor more natural when loading files, references are therefore
    stored along with the document.

    The <src-arg|table> is of a similar form as above. In this case a tuple
    is associated to each label. This tuple is either of the form
    <explain-macro|tuple|content|page-nr> or
    <explain-macro|tuple|content|page-nr|file>. The <src-arg|content>
    corresponds to the displayed text when referring to the label,
    <src-arg|page-nr> to the corresponding page number, and the optional
    <src-arg|file> to the file where the label was defined (this is only used
    when the file is part of a project).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|auxiliary|table><explain-synopsis|auxiliary data
  attached to the file>>
    This optional tag specifies all auxiliary data attached to the document.
    Usually, such auxiliary data can be recomputed automatically from the
    document, but such recomputations may be expensive and even require tools
    which are not necessarily installed on your system. The <src-arg|table>,
    which is specified in a similar way as above, associates auxiliary
    content to a key. Standard keys include <verbatim|bib>, <verbatim|toc>,
    <verbatim|idx>, <verbatim|gly>, <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\example>
    An article with the simple text ``hello world!'' is represented as

    <\equation*>
      <tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|document>>|<tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|TeXmacs>>|<with|mode|text|<TeXmacs-version>>>|<tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|style>>|article>|<tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|body>>|<tree|<with|mode|text|<markup|document>>|hello
      world!>>>
    </equation*>
  </example>

  <paragraph|Basic buffer management>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-list)><explain-synopsis|list of all buffers>
  <|explain>
    This routine returns the list of all open buffers.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(current-buffer)><explain-synopsis|current buffer>
  <|explain>
    Return the current view. The program may abort if there exists no current
    buffer.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(path-\<gtr\>buffer <scm-arg|p>)><explain-synopsis|buffer which
    contains a certain path>
  <|explain>
    Return the buffer which contains a certain path <scm-arg|p>, or <scm|#f>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tree-\<gtr\>buffer <scm-arg|t>)><explain-synopsis|buffer which
    contains a certain tree>
  <|explain>
    Return the buffer which contains a certain tree <scm-arg|t>, or <scm|#f>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-\<gtr\>views <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|list of views
    on a buffer>
  <|explain>
    This routine returns the list of views on the buffer <scm-arg|buf>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-\<gtr\>windows <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|list of
    windows containing buffer>
  <|explain>
    This routine returns the list of windows in which the buffer
    <scm-arg|buf> is currently being displayed.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-new)><explain-synopsis|create a new buffer>
  <|explain>
    Create a new buffer and returns its URL.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-rename <scm-arg|buf> <scm-arg|new-name>)><explain-synopsis|create
    a new buffer>
  <|explain>
    Give a new name <scm-arg|new-name> to the buffer <scm-arg|buf>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(switch-to-buffer <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|switch the
    editor's focus>
  <|explain>
    Switch the editor's focus to the buffer <scm-arg|buf>.
  </explain>

  <paragraph|Information associated to buffers>

    <scm|(buffer-set <scm-arg|buf> <scm-arg|rich-t>)>

    <scm|(buffer-get <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|set/get the contents of
    the buffer>
  <|explain>
    Set the contents of the buffer <scm-arg|buf> to the rich tree
    <scm-arg|rich-t>, <abbr|resp.> get the rich contents of <scm-arg|buf>.
    Rich trees do not only contain the actual body of the document, but also
    some meta-data, such as its style, initial values of environment
    variables, and other auxiliary data attached to the document.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-set-body <scm-arg|buf> <scm-arg|t>)>

    <scm|(buffer-get-body <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|set/get the main
    body of the buffer>
  <|explain>
    Set the main body of the buffer <scm-arg|buf> to the tree <scm-arg|t>,
    <abbr|resp.> get the main body of <scm-arg|buf>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-set-master <scm-arg|buf> <scm-arg|master>)>

    <scm|(buffer-get-master <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|set/get the
    master of the buffer>
  <|explain>
    Set the master of the buffer <scm-arg|buf> to <scm-arg|master>,
    <abbr|resp.> get the master of <scm-arg|buf>. The master of a buffer
    should again be a buffer. Usually, the master of a buffer is the buffer
    itself. Otherwise, the buffer will behave similarly as its master in some
    respects. For instance, if a buffer <verbatim|a/b.tm> admits
    <verbatim|x/y.tm> as its master, then a hyperlink to <verbatim|c.tm> will
    point to <verbatim|x/c.tm> and not to <verbatim|a/c.tm>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-set-title <scm-arg|buf> <scm-arg|name>)>

    <scm|(buffer-get-title <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|set/get the title
    of the buffer>
  <|explain>
    Set the title of the buffer <scm-arg|buf> to the string <scm-arg|name>,
    <abbr|resp.> get the title of <scm-arg|buf>. The title is for instance
    used as the title for the window.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-set-title <scm-arg|buf> <scm-arg|name>)>

    <scm|(buffer-get-title <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|set/get the title
    of the buffer>
  <|explain>
    Set the title of the buffer <scm-arg|buf> to the string <scm-arg|name>,
    <abbr|resp.> get the title of <scm-arg|buf>. The title is for instance
    used as the title for the window.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-last-save <scm-arg|buf>)>

    <scm|(buffer-last-visited <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|time when a
    buffer was visited/saved last>
  <|explain>
    Return the time when the buffer <scm-arg|buf> was visited or saved last.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-modified? <scm-arg|buf>)>

    <scm|(buffer-pretend-saved <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|check for
    modifications since last save>
  <|explain>
    The predicate <scm|buffer-modified?> check whether the buffer
    <scm-arg|buf> was modified since the last time it was saved. The routine
    <scm|buffer-pretend-saved> can be used in order to pretend that
    the<nbsp>buffer <scm-arg|buf> was saved, without actually saving it. This
    can for instance be useful if no worthwhile changes occurred in the
    buffer since the genuine last save.
  </explain>

  <paragraph|Synchronizing with the external world>

  Buffers inside <TeXmacs> usually correspond to actual files on disk or
  elsewhere. When changes occur on either side (<abbr|e.g.> when editing the
  buffer, or modifying the file on disk using an external program), the
  following routines can be used in order to synchronize the buffer inside
  <TeXmacs> with its corresponding file on disk.

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-load <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|load buffer>
  <|explain>
    Retrieve the buffer <scm-arg|buf> from disk (or elsewhere). Returns
    <scm|#t> on error and <scm|#f> otherwise. The format being used for
    loading files is chosen as a function of the extension of <scm-arg|buf>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-save <scm-arg|buf>)><explain-synopsis|save buffer>
  <|explain>
    Save the buffer <scm-arg|buf> to disk (or elsewhere). Returns <scm|#t> on
    error and <scm|#f> otherwise. The format being used for saving files is
    chosen as a function of the extension of <scm-arg|buf>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-import <scm-arg|buf> <scm-arg|src>
    <scm-arg|fm>)><explain-synopsis|import buffer>
  <|explain>
    Import the buffer <scm-arg|buf> from <scm-arg|src>, using the format
    <scm-arg|fm>. Returns <scm|#t> on error and <scm|#f> otherwise.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(buffer-export <scm-arg|buf> <scm-arg|dest>
    <scm-arg|fm>)><explain-synopsis|export buffer>
  <|explain>
    Export the buffer <scm-arg|buf> to <scm-arg|dest>, using the format
    <scm-arg|fm>. Returns <scm|#t> on error and <scm|#f> otherwise.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tree-import <scm-arg|src> <scm-arg|fm>)><explain-synopsis|import a
    tree>
  <|explain>
    Import a tree from the URL <scm-arg|src>, using the format <scm-arg|fm>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(tree-export <scm-arg|t> <scm-arg|dest>
    <scm-arg|fm>)><explain-synopsis|export a tree>
  <|explain>
    Export a tree to the URL <scm-arg|dest>, using the format <scm-arg|fm>.

  <tmdoc-title|Helper macros for rendering section titles>

  The <tmdtd|section-base> <abbr|d.t.d.> contains several helper macros which
  can (should) be used when customizing the rendering of section titles:

  <\explain>
    <explain-macro|sectional-short|body>

    <explain-macro|sectional-short-italic|body>

    <explain-macro|sectional-short-bold|body>
  <|explain>
    These macros should be used for rendering ``short section titles'', for
